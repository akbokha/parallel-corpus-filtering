Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former ground of peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to be up@@ set because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; the big picture postcard became more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; judge &quot; &quot; cards for towns and communities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originates from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops attacked the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide area of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische verification administration . &quot;
the original piece of composition for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a district of Munich . &quot;
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : while the Hin@@ ein@@ zo@@ oming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the property was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no longer farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the north of sub @-@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest , was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judgment sheet , in the area of the present area Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field road , one once locked people with del@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example ended the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , it was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - in architectural bor@@ rowing of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , was destroyed by bom@@ bing attacks during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 1856 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger@@ straße &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke into the inner city .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day was the preparation and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony took place for the second S @-@ Bahn branch . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
citizen rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colored men , who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur l@@ ately throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release date warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline and was taken custo@@ dy by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
the Council also points to a recently published report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be prepared if they bring Cau@@ tion money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the United States adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have implemented the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing bacher pasture project is a success project and will continue next year .
the representatives of the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have shown themselves on the spot .
&quot; in the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and is accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative commerci@@ alization way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; electric fence project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep areas .
&quot; gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project , and is happy with the support of leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers should be supported . &quot;
hope that the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants .
&quot; thus , the closing area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs tot@@ aled EUR 71 500 , half of the population was promoted , a quarter contributed to the village of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and land@@ women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Landscape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a material drawn by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be economical ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence around 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the fisher@@ man &apos;s turn@@ out project 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the exposure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the president on the dramatic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked her meaning , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus was added , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stir@@ ring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your afflic@@ ted masses , who year@@ ns to breathe freely , the el@@ ong@@ ating waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable gar@@ bage &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around America &apos;s importance .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical depic@@ tion .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ aming of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inv@@ ading anyone but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ cl@@ ad , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh was hit by something here . &quot;
the importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever wanted to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when only two Schot@@ ten belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the Power Director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship Series &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; your capit@@ aine talk was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally gathered were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ alli@@ sts , who compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was to be seen after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as an established ath@@ l@@ ete , athletes , who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete there , and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking critics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public ministry if you cannot toler@@ ate the fate of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ch@@ imp@@ lied with the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we will be led to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted entries of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union did not compl@@ ain about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary h@@ ag@@ gle .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum which is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Minister A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the Comments section &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor described as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical notes and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but exactly this just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell in Virginia last week .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County won the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she called a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers hit his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field last year , was associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken in the year after I had won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour at his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free of charge , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attribut@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hous@@ ings prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; said the leader of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not stated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction works again and again , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and off @-@ lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the street is locked and only the regular buses are allowed to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately , we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner they don &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ iment in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the min@@ ted tu@@ ber will be removed with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into everyday life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ s up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which sustain@@ s control over the region and exclude foreign journalists or legal observations . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron com@@ partments that have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
only very few Indonesian people made their journey here because journalists and practically no foreigners .
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built gold and copper at the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the total amount of USD 78 billion is estimated on wood resources . &quot;
&quot; this wealth , however , is a source of misery for the Papua people that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars in one single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Jews have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal state in the 1970 @-@ s have been genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we Will Under@@ stand Every@@ thing &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture , ra@@ pes and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have reinforced since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ anu@@ t sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local populations , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved into the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Papua , the Mama Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua there was little change , and today the locals feel dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children went out and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers increased their tone and later returned with four soldiers , thus the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ro@@ bes , said sacrifice and witness . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and carried out the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - running continuously and a bird @-@ singing in the circle - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started drag@@ ging stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here came . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , security minister Wir@@ anto said that he will establish an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 1990s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes going through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5th , and said he did not have plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been buried in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims have accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ is@@ cated in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who responded by fir@@ ing warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly included here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to draw the involved officers into account and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua movement by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custo@@ dy , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as far out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new immigrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and well @-@ educated immigrants .
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report about Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , who visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people jour@@ ne@@ yed and forced him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia also has another presidential election , but the Papua people say they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educ@@ ation@@ - and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other states , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sh@@ ut @-@ victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ ses of a victim was buried on a site exactly vis @-@ à @-@ vis the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest dormit@@ ories in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
it is the second brand that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years that you acci@@ dentally call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George att@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident may re@@ anim@@ ate questions about security of materials used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , the outer cover for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two divi@@ den@@ ds , as thin as not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics are thus preserved to the traditional rat@@ b . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.4 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue working to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many claims , the proposal had already come to leave the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details , so the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the following year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ er , the requirements for training plans etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers get banned items into the aircraft , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had been delayed , that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted by more than 1,000 people - a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents said they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passing by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to know know@@ ingly carried things with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many ad@@ vert@@ ently sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had caused by airport security , and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids may take them with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items being conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
liquids are allowed on inland flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel
&quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ lined that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the constantly trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales goals , Tes@@ la @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed a different , less glan@@ cing figure for the first time in announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly survey : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is clean : from the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 reservations , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in the event of a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations en@@ vis@@ aged , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss doesn &apos;t believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 - all models will be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never @-@ tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s from Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s execution to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presents the changes that his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline exp@@ ended on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt has announced that he will delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repe@@ ats repeatedly to block or delay regul@@ ators who resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the roll@@ back regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington ruled that the EPA Administrator has crossed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that O@@ zone standards simply intensi@@ fy the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be accused of groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for implementation , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said that the EPA compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s position said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who headed the Coalition of States who had compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , on Sunday 16th July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm , a seren@@ ade is invited . &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius site a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village small gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customer Book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the ab@@ bey church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the document , according to the document stood on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as described in the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; is the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village . &quot;
old maps out of time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Big@@ ger of the two bar@@ ges on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
&quot; in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were cut and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp near the church .
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the steep@@ le and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em care about the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ ner &quot; &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility . &quot;
&quot; as an organizer , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are invited on Sunday 16th July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler high school Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the for@@ e@@ word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility that is of importance for tum@@ bl@@ ers and audi@@ tors .
&quot; the friends and supporters of tum@@ ours feel particularly obliged to their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association wants to let approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; does not look any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has been promp@@ ted by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it was un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city . &quot;
these zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette for a few days before , but it had not approved Düsseldorf &apos;s district government because of a mol@@ ded mis@@ sile . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore rejected , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a approval by the district government still stands out . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen for past week , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it for the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they are probably not leading to the fact that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company in which the town Vier@@ sen contributed indirectly , lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ inhabitants households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ haus gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred at the Friday afternoon at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded k@@ ingly .
two more persons were easily injured .
the Landes@@ straße was closed for hours .
&quot; after police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took her car in the frame of the accompanied driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
&quot; the commercial sector and city administration intend to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to attract the inhabitants to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own town away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , local companies will present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal authorities and commercial associations cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial sector and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers , such as the first &quot; &quot; active @-@ day &quot; &quot; for well @-@ known Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and owners to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ unc@@ ement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end all would have to help to anim@@ ate the city centre - to land@@ lords , farms of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had partially spread , the king had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , agreed that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with its purchasing behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later also found dead .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as a disaster , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the holiday season , only a few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump bet after sent calls from telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a phone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly tell that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President insul@@ ted him because he had den@@ o@@ unced the wall publicly . according to say , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to Australia &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull : &quot; that &apos;s the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in the countryside Mon@@ roe , Georgia and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside spi@@ ed the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger &apos;s seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience took a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to mim@@ ic the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been g@@ yn@@ a@@ zed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of post @-@ creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we seek prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
a court physician places a cloth on the cor@@ p@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the neighbouring coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their vote in the summer pres@@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; roughly at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black color ten@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby that she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
&quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concluded a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a der@@ ision between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in killing , removing evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual follow @-@ up of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - were forced into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , ta@@ sted their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sha@@ king and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ aving away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ jects fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but &quot; , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy moves in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are sh@@ outs , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a dream dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many just come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they all have experienced Georgi@@ as for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , if one stands on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels dispens@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead body . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ pers together . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wi@@ pe out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks in their arms crying together ; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table a white couple from Atlanta is talking about the post@@ position with a black pair , which they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky strug@@ gl@@ ed to find words which feeling the performance left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a diverse , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Mauer@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ timer par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ pots pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which pul@@ ls through his &quot; Ring &quot; stage . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ pots - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s run Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , err@@ en into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen which sur@@ rounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) also has to believe in it . &quot;
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who humble himself and supp@@ ressed the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te will be celebrated in a stor@@ my way . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 , he had still had a ball @-@ bearing concert about himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is happy about this .
&quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of whose view has grown . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I would like to help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at the school in an open day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you are doing .
&quot; do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see as it is on site , in the focus perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne is a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in post @-@ afternoon support . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that mat@@ ured to me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than in civil engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
one always has other people in front of them who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family , must always be dealt with individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
&quot; for that , I am not the type . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , great kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ tens another 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , the General Director John Fall@@ on mainly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 points . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul in the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , sharing a statement by N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; worn explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite Shi@@ p district . &quot;
the Taliban said they did this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the U.S. led troops displac@@ ed the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is weighing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule after Dep@@ os@@ its
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled after which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states compl@@ ained of the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced the decision on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ eness 2015 &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt has announced the intent of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed a suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature groups who are worried about the effects of major emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipality wants community @-@ space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ zeln decides the establishment of a joint space in the future senior home facility . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the property is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take a long time until the area of the church is still owned by the church community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council propose to fores@@ ee such a common room , not as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but openly to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision adopted by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided in autumn , by means of funding . &quot;
the building is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution looks to signal the investor that in this respect , you don &apos;t want to throw a b@@ ump between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning on the ambient lighting - as well as a desk roof - which reduces the lowering height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings that are not quite advanced , but they are now in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger den@@ ies itself absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any wealth or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real value in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to submit the proposed resolutions , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we make the decision so we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
colli@@ sion with car : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led on street
at crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth was captured by a car and heavily injured .
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by bicycle on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer trail from Hil@@ den on the bike path of Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
one in the same direction driving car driver granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite . &quot;
he met a car that controls a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ er .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a retri@@ eval car .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel matters , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first season of the season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the podium .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football record champion Bayern München is getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ab@@ stain from the BA@@ B with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights moves the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the Harz Mountains
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; to the information needs of many visitors , was called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be complemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot;
Acc@@ essi@@ bility is also a criterion .
later the train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star trail the viewers will learn a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star stronger light than another , even though it was essentially far@@ ther away . &quot;
in which con@@ stellation I find a selected star and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory of Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the national park resin belongs to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy are clearly visible with naked eye .
&quot; in the university town , there has been something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium , Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ es leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planet degra@@ ded plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6,5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light of sun is needed up to the plug for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian is thus faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko met for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a colli@@ sion course in order to stage the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super Spring Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
&quot; and he has to move on lightweight boards &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight cap@@ tions in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight might take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans were asking for it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names may generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko lasted with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three combat champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Cor@@ rec@@ tions to Ty@@ res of Ty@@ re
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control over his vehicle shortly before the connecting point of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 in direction north was closed for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident point . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain functions better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , because not the two ad@@ vers@@ aries were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two ad@@ vers@@ aries too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple @-@ chain should be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a breach , the For@@ tun@@ en no longer want to catch up . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better in preparing with the triple qu@@ ill than with the qu@@ ill .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the triple @-@ bet on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , but that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ led start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can stay on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I only judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ matur@@ ely for an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent@@ ages where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a light favorite on Sunday into the encounter at last , at last ( almost ) finished stadium by Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we have to swe@@ ep them , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be beat in advance , &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant , arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Candi@@ date Test published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun to carry out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take more exact estim@@ ation of age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees , which were minor years . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the accommod@@ ated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ adet ad@@ jour@@ ned the 5@@ 81 results , she discovered that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , for x @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work covers the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we should not pret@@ end to be as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is negli@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the department of road and traffic in the Pres@@ idency of the District of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve and / or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap .
&quot; this is a boundary wire , which is also used as an operating system . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters wide bridge should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path should go .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special dex@@ ter@@ ity has caused the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished initially . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ les is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ dler Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell into the &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the event start , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the well , but is now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums One World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many officials after Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel has reported that he tried to have such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at 20 o &apos;clock in the Stadthalle , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ D President Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall that wait for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests at the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ PM in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in wind music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to transc@@ end not only the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new style , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; un@@ ites himself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz @-@ bri@@ tish N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Monastery Church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art openly about her bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ on , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette performer faces the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I updated . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten found that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never got confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , she cried out loud &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some consider myself to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and lots of reflections ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump in advance promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the Clinton H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an evident dism@@ iss@@ al from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed into the sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been grab@@ bed for gold and silver medals in cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realised that it has experienced some rather hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress does not support the recommendations of Task Force that it is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Athle@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
a St@@ ob@@ itu@@ ary for Mali St@@ oked Sol@@ di@@ ers
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two killed on a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; on the other hand , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two up@@ side pilots as &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her s@@ war@@ ts were transferred to Germany and brought to the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at mid@@ day , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the fun@@ eral ceremony took place in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the g@@ asses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the s@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense of the Ley@@ en described the up@@ setting soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had established the flight operation of the Figh@@ ter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; If this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show doubts about the UN mission in Mali : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the s@@ war@@ ts were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen had agreed to her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a rum@@ our that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired and also included the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ re@@ mahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ person of the Danish royal court . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand at the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
that were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament voted for the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the astonishing outlet of a Gre@@ ens Parliament in Lower Saxony had thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Group president Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to record it .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new country tag will be re @-@ elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally clean@@ ly checked , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in silence , one will discuss all the questions when they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something curi@@ ously .
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ itor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country mandate .
&quot; we , of course , assume that she has received her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; divided the pres@@ idents of Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extraordinary . &quot;
she has decided to do no pr@@ on@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the betra@@ yal of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens Members El@@ ke T@@ westen on the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly select the parliament &apos;s parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political press &quot; &quot; in its last vanity and in its fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony contributes to this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and tries to kno@@ ck out political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the result of the country election in 2013 with personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answers in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poll@@ uted eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even , if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house was immediately switched off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the subject of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturers take care that the sold products are transport@@ able and health harmless .
&quot; if the residual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transport@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time are not the companies to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not blame for immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little controllers in the case of serious diar@@ rho@@ ea . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; this is precisely why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be submitted , are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made a clear clari@@ fication of the fact that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain safe and worthy food only .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the counter@@ f@@ eit funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ capable animals is un@@ acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts are quickly and completely enligh@@ tened . &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted issues of European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar sign and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the vast ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they must interact with legitimate revenue sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will ampli@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the deposit sum for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a cash penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ look their financial supervision by raising their income through companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar in 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador will be easy to find out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean , that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial intelligence &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white s@@ og@@ g@@ ill@@ boards , packed with 14 grams , distribute the flight att@@ endants in front of landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a jo@@ g manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; like many applicants , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the agreement over the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
the opportunity to place the logo was Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the conf@@ ection@@ er Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is distributed by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; this re@@ petition of history is simultaneously nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children , who will grow - nevertheless they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally u@@ pro@@ oted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the found@@ ational principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That Do@@ es the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point a character is rum@@ ma@@ ging by an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ esque , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ icious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bar@@ t from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could provoke this fran@@ chise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director speci@@ fies to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ised in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Find the voice &apos; . &quot;
but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; gets involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reag@@ an mask is involved - that it is often played like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; who was re@@ mitted to a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American emb@@ assy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a success .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed , as the public prosec@@ utor insi@@ sted on Friday . &quot;
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
two people were arrested in the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised crimin@@ ality , heavy acts of violence , murder and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor has established Kon@@ stanz against organised drug traff@@ icking in the south @-@ German area . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale use on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the view of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were primarily concerned with the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ b@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
fashion compl@@ ains great gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner regi@@ sters in Germany considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ Central Register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to serious mis@@ choices in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to figures , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is thus managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 had been found in individual cases , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizen and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data inputs can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of char@@ geable people , EU citizens are covered who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false decre@@ es , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with char@@ geable people , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started sending refugees back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF introduce such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the travel destination . &quot;
&quot; as a justi@@ fication , the Office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service already provided for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now received 100 litres of blood , has now distributed 100 litres of blood . &quot;
traditionally the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our body is laid out for it and we must respect the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , corn production reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the transition to the theatre house just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted among the multiple @-@ giving and were awarded for 50 paid blood donations each . &quot;
&quot; half as many bookings Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ lei@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter made ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation about an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to grow the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h business package released one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February , although it is now expected that they will make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to affect consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling down inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets are expected . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the Bank however stressed that enh@@ ancements would be gradual &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these messages .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rates , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and low levels of sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be avoided in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of her three @-@ year pro@@ g@@ nosis will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the ple@@ a .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding a rise to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank has said that this was expected and will be re @-@ tigh@@ tened over the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that the exceed@@ ance of 2 % to its goal was &quot; entirely &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ br@@ is , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; in the light of recent s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are off , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle before the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to the sexual intercourse pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) that can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now comes from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdi@@ ct by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) recorded this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in all England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ p ) proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV agents that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified in clinics that will agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a GP may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the total potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used specifically , absorbed and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention was to supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is yet another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive on NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said , &quot; This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one , who has a risk of HIV , is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test is sour@@ ced , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , made a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge at Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overl@@ apping , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the award .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other without having to pick us up .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to function longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units provide space for all the Cut@@ lery and Gl@@ asses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is always important , so when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to increase the surface area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love you in electric power sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ oom of somewhat standard into something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of the biggest real estate empire of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and Developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their capacity should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
the family West@@ co jeans established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - of Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the jud@@ gements proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , like Paul , claims to have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the quar@@ rel . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance notes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners , and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that when leaving the company mark 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not wish that Paul and I would end in our current conflict , &quot; he said , and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .

&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with senior employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media device . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television stretches back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Kan@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump has been anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; said the ex @-@ election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter &apos;s custom was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never find out about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his colleagues managed to keep it away from him a couple of times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from causing tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , who are composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ors of the advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a vul@@ cano to negative press cuts , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy commander K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most searched crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped . &quot;
&quot; in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als , the police throughout Europe will be sent to the flight . &quot;
&quot; as the addresses of the heavy crimin@@ als are not known , they will be hoped for and asked for guidance from the population . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar in winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le in tourist destinations are hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ des@@ .com has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online requests could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travelers on the foot of the war , who have negoti@@ ated a dig@@ ging from the community to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry people attacked the council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame on the implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the counsel of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect her parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my dest@@ abili@@ zation when the Council can &apos;t even stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pill@@ aged by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ hull &apos;s council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible .
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente Operation Company mbH on 13 April 2014 , about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees entering the district , the hotel building was offered to the governor &apos;s office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented placing asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time by serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already have long time construction @-@ shuttle in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be made . &quot;
&quot; floors were torn out , blank@@ ets are partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a up@@ scale city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with OB @-@ Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the not@@ ions of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just below a million euros , it pays off . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which is open to the restaurant , which is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us @-@ Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller asked for a report to a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
&quot; the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N reported , there are already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men who acted in the election campaign as advis@@ ers of the re@@ public@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; signed a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump sums up personally into the centre and investigate whether the president may have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the charges of charges .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for the hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were exhibited that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , as well as his wife Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were involved in the discussion . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he , if necessary , wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charges of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; amid the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work , however , usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI director James Com@@ ey told three times that not to be determined against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been no@@ isy , he refused to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to susp@@ end the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump mu@@ eller would be released .
&quot; unlike an independent Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative bodies on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg acceler@@ ates in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
&quot; in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a giant ic@@ eberg has solved itself from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s by just about seven times . &quot;
this was the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus spread over one tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , research is uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual collap@@ ses in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ torial background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken colony was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and cra@@ cking was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete chess puzzle is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and sque@@ eze the ice so much water as it results after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and no direct link to climate change is aware of , the iron sign comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; Our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; although these scientists do not cause the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have fallen in recent decades . &quot;
this long summit of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the polar surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med by about three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to maintain house tari@@ ff for personnel
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U asks to leave the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have been linked . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have left their first working day . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously much sought @-@ after .
around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places that were allocated this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied places at M@@ ett@@ mann County .
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and challenge the shortage of skilled workers in administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for trans@@ verse clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is from a &quot; &quot; real &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , who have disease or age @-@ related reasons , come from the service . &quot;
&quot; so the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
he had long been anxi@@ ously anxi@@ ous for a f@@ aust@@ ere surprise when he publicly challenged the expenses of personnel and stun@@ ned the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the circular management should be with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to better pay the employees and officials than the tari@@ ffs for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money is only when you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy shar@@ pen@@ es the tone to NGO migrants
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue , if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation for one year , refused to express itself to the Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in an opinion to the social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently recru@@ ited after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that its crew takes sail@@ boat migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to be only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ take over the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ al Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharp@@ ly over the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine ham@@ lets bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Palat@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim zur Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , viewpoint at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ doors brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atory incur@@ able br@@ ine .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Palat@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ Sport
&quot; in future , sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather over the stadium arc@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included . &quot;
we have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and at the end of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that on this train several clubs will rise . &quot;
&quot; next weekend FIFA World Cup organizes FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke &amp; Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven won . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the German Association to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation FIFA are being fought at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the pro@@ s compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and at the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certain to be used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport , because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid re@@ activity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform when playing online and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , because there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) prec@@ edes the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
sales at 130 million are expected to lie in three years .
&quot; against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
many countries are already moving forward .
big markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga clubs , according to Dut@@ t , are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time setting up the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; also means Dut@@ t . &quot;
you can &apos;t cling to that only when football is all the way it was always .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter is sentenced to suicide due to the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced to life in June due to negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward directed eyes when she was sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that it completely de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; old or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a Prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who compl@@ ained that there was &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I interact with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she is &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she will never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person , with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts making it a crime to claim another suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters had revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , refresh yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was asked by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from the fall by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain in the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there .
&quot; something else was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself divided the blind to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as a Bayern captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f in the professionals , deb@@ tors and just out of the holiday , but he was chosen . &quot;
you would like to distribute sugar to those you want to keep a lot that you want to keep in mood .
&quot; so , who has been chosen to take the hei@@ r of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ ber confirmed , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ ashed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
&quot; to the right rear , this is its position , the white B@@ ind on the arm did rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim was working in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm into the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the unwanted tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , to join the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia journey ( also limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in the Bavaria Tri@@ k@@ ot would not be negative . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ ber , Ru@@ dy ran off against the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a neat performance at the debut .
&quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy didn &apos;t give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ my said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few notes .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what goes down here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows after more than a year , in which the new Economy Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; even this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the West Bank of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transportation road@@ map . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minister of the Minist@@ eri@@ st Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) of Trier is striving for , as in Wis@@ sing , an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the I@@ HK lo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the completed championship examination and 2500 Euro if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction should be quickly facts , but at the same time lack@@ ed the required personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 29 places have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set knowledge in the state @-@ run mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce asks to give more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Vice Christian Bald@@ auf will refer to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , less than proposed by country roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a rating of 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about increasing internet connections and break@@ outs .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become a president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already cleared the field after four months because of discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gas ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles also assume what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dis@@ connecting the powerful automobile companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called waste products that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer we@@ ars di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .

&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most published carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ ies of his characters are his hall@@ mark . &quot;
even with 85 the Argent@@ ini@@ er still stands and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - what frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures are in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing table , working every day for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and clo@@ cks continue to be widely spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ th as an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he sits rather on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought , causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has caused a lot less rain in the past years and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil is not only available for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to d@@ rought . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were in 2009 the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and ab@@ domin@@ als range . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make Mexico &apos;s chaos dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest break from violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken up his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , who show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ers linked to drug traff@@ icking each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting about security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with the &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but in Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug royal which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
&quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez had become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed ais@@ le members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez to fail , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without h@@ itting smoking , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved it to be able to publish hard meetings without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you need to take on the task that runs as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel that could flu@@ ke like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space in which the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no phones allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who described the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sia has printed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled nearly the whole century all political planes .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez were regarded as the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken up with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by having written in organised protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has then requested that she is once again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , the government officials involved and a &quot; &quot; uniform society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug trade is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , as at once all their phones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ e@@ ri@@ val and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region . &quot;
from the on@@ board edge you published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ls nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez gave a look at the police officers holding the guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said , it would have had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; the padded din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r items in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ si@@ ers , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Erd@@ kl@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you smile just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r examples - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a wall @-@ changing tank , was probably threatened by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to interfere better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ shad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shad@@ ings are common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r ch@@ ased enough pressure from meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs to promote the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the shade - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ r was subjected to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r showing how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal based on his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ate , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ o is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r standing on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank into the sea after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the padded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the average creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 inches long lace sha@@ ved by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater heritage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so good that the skin @-@ bar still covers hol@@ lowed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the fet@@ ched ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous last , kilomet@@ re @-@ long st@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were at 17.00 hours between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm about 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , inter@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was easy to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large amount of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long reg@@ ression was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by a AZ repor@@ ter , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - with numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ched the hall@@ marks of the vehicle manufacturers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. there was another accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicopter helicopter was on the way to the accident point .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an uns@@ an@@ ted or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
card @-@ check .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn currently tests the wireless ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , testing runs on two lines . &quot;
&quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a rail spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the rail the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought it via the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so that one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; the train companion at the ticket control at number Y knows , that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go on to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train staff , check in the DB navig@@ ator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to person@@ alize their journey time in the train , &quot; &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , marketing executive board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives the train , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions belong to the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card , or otherwise a document you have to prove . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time takes care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart meal .
other draw numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being prayed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she laid her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police band and people crying , and from a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman escaped his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; Con@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled their statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have become ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt .
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the people &apos;s point of view who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had numerous times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I was lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any ec@@ centric rac@@ ism , she is not different from the next black female child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
&quot; they prepared bags , and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ ited by their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ al &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah guide , but a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ al &apos;s life , as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .

we have nothing to lose - besides our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while they say one to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ ena ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which also the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of construction , it will be an end . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a Square , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again . &quot;
also the but@@ cher shop we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent . &quot;
this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s a shopping paradise in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; sorry , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer &apos;s market be present during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot;
&quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , selling all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - no place for sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable resem@@ bl@@ ance : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the thirty portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st claimed a 35 @-@ year sentence after she publicly critic@@ ised the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ bl@@ ance ( a suitable resem@@ bl@@ ance ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking Dis@@ si@@ eur , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ical data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , openly condemned as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 , among them six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which p@@ anning obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum bl@@ ond - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of foreign arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette dum@@ pl@@ ings and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became an un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ ec@@ ond who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which pre@@ dict a future in which the president would turn to Chel@@ seas &apos;s verdi@@ ct and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , man &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome way of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; even now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths , in order to infl@@ ame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called for her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is end@@ owed with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , said Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a free talk phone .
&quot; when they speak your speech , then they have won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; p@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was supposed to be taken away in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who were chosen as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) , arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by Cook County &apos;s Local Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several years . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority was that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ vera has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them now have been rated and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them , rein@@ force , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
security cameras have been confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for adher@@ ence to the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement of R@@ USA@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the dop@@ ing approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; We carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has failed to make a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ cos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody before to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the wake of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als . &quot;
it was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ USA@@ DA moved into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start ups that will help your company do not become the next hu@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce startup but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups to handle employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
he said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken , were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
it has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were formerly hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship can be identified quicker and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take on ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are limited . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices and that the work they are doing is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose men , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot tops and show their back full sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water sport center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a real tre@@ k for the guys , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood executed practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s regime change even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it , they plac@@ ches on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practice as soon as the camp is over , resulting in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a tor@@ post , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then stop there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fac@@ ten@@ bank audi@@ tors from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods , in order to identify potential mis@@ understand@@ ings and to send them to fac@@ tual checks that may possibly display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan after which social media networks are to be punished if it does not succeed in getting h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that a test of the new facts check will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ ten@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes in his news feed to reduce false messages .

&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book written by Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he would be there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &apos; greeting , &quot; ) seems to be so beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape fle@@ urs , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards that represent what was said : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to immer@@ se on a broader basis into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising in this area began , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the sm@@ u@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ ys his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite g@@ aun@@ er , making debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise land@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has had a bi @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium of the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the covering of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z the logo and slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we believe that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the event more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef reduces its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on Pen@@ sion@@ ings and Promot@@ ions in Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps . &quot;
this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five Vice @-@ Govern@@ ors , as well as the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of transi@@ tions . &quot;
the government pic@@ ks up the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; general Staff of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar is in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the n@@ avy were dismis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since the coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who were to participate immediately in the attempted put@@ sch , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara following this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an referred to the overthrow of the revolution as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an really got the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; dis@@ comfort in military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale system in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an was fired by a decree of further 73@@ 95 nation@@ als , among them 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country earlier .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an insi@@ sted on the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers , Erd@@ og@@ an , specifically advoc@@ ate an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly not @-@ called officer who searched for asylum from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not leave N@@ ato cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges doubt of the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he proposes to lower the legal immigrants on 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the United States will change the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the US media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate circuit for race transportation
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the race circuit has been disp@@ uted - now it should go quite quickly . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , on the mar@@ vel track , on which the tourist train is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , construction work will start again this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared Secretary of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route calculated to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally approved , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thuring@@ ian Railway as the operator agree on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should be ordered by the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the underground stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , the route of sufficient number of people was used to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be even crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , thereby choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing to them , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; who convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the Website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one step up to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : opposing ) Far@@ rah is concerned , distur@@ b one the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ es with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to a somewhat dar@@ ker and lowering in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what escap@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain exagger@@ ation that these highly developed sex robots ab@@ ound in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has chosen to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ bl@@ ance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
your builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are f@@ aint slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the way of speech by 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a shr@@ ink@@ age of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized U.S. voters , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving in the United States newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of dump @-@ sel@@ ectable relatives .
we are all suppos@@ edly committed to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to accommodate families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them including republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom they strug@@ gl@@ ed for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar to the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it &apos;s in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ic possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when tr@@ ump comes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ousel of the New York City Park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals turn out to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mat@@ ing music puts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many cli@@ ch@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the them@@ ed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ising , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was transferred to hospital due to the treatment of cuts , which he reported to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; for murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder , following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by opening it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ turn@@ al inv@@ ader , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too far@@ si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it appe@@ als to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds an odd egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ apped people from Finn@@ s and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the dormit@@ ory students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol for the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eag@@ les under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the m@@ lower scarf introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Hüh@@ ner@@ hof . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found an odd egg , and caused it to brood from its ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken soup a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him , and the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain , and sw@@ aying . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the burning d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , carrying the cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Head of Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ person äss@@ ler to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who is navig@@ ating again and again at school courses , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen season is over now , the class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; she just kid@@ n@@ apped her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ ke@@ epers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
B@@ TV reported that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa offers ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not a precise date yet . &quot;
Daimler advised to write any person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long can the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in says . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the auto manufacturers do not act on the issue of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fear this .
&quot; but even in the regions , where road b@@ ans are dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older dies@@ els so far . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale .

&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ urer , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been the &quot; &quot; Stadt@@ bau@@ meister &quot; . &quot; &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he shows in the press room .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it surprised him that so far no application would fulfill the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time .
&quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub @-@ authority , the applicant must show appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill them out , then the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizen clos@@ eness to the city and it is important for himself , says W@@ acker who reports from a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have been gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the construction department and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the low @-@ ho@@ fen par@@ ked area are app@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium refur@@ bishment is still subject matter . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ ure is available for a city building master large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dener can be responded to many quite flexibly .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often referred to by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits &quot; if new buildings are approved , the separ@@ able Stadt@@ bau@@ urer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Mayor bears a great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants himself : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) under@@ lines civil engineering , building guidance , basic affairs affairs , administration of urban properties , Municipal equipment with building yard and city gar@@ dener as well as Lower Building Law Authority , including protection of monuments . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : Süd@@ bahn@@ route locked
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail track across the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene a pink pi@@ er and a bike rider were watched by witnesses .
&quot; this goes far beyond a realm of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
he or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves to a great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , even pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; all in all , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the Süd@@ bahn@@ route could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten passenger trains were off Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the long distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight elev@@ ators did not come out , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ ats , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person affected is usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been established that a kind of tolerance fo@@ stering the immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said , &quot; We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet that rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to a more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el metabolism if the same system also causes people . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , this did not . &quot;
&quot; they presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ases of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in g@@ astro@@ intestinal tracts . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enc@@ ers and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained from L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tracts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pres@@ e@@ ason , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u took off in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho form his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent dismis@@ sed three further commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ itation for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic Prime Ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; merely no fire @-@ fire from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the Bund - thus was the most important wish of the bal@@ lot milit@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were cr@@ ates .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not reign supreme , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the country elections , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the surrender to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s desire .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Elec@@ toral Co@@ uns@@ ellor of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; it must not be true yet , &quot; &quot; a SPD candidate si@@ ghs , when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the aband@@ on@@ ment of the green members El@@ ke T@@ westen on the CD@@ U without own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary high point of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no longer , the comrades reas@@ sured at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that was then also - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te breath@@ ed the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks afterwards , the comrades approached again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next low blow .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD candidate , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in times of crisis communications , he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival . &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 50@@ 6 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; because of the VW @-@ emission @-@ revolution@@ aries and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
aggregate demand values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to acc@@ ent the league in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party from Wei@@ l . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the Party @-@ internal force of the Lower Saxony @-@ Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , on the absurd parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen poses her own career fairs beyond the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but on the provincial list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the lower @-@ Saxon parliam@@ ent@@ arians continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er of four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career @-@ giving of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clearing the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments from the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding funds for town core III
who wants to renov@@ ate house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG city development announced on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what was happening so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at that time , in the refur@@ bishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the area of refur@@ bishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement still stood at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the renovation of existing refur@@ bish@@ ments is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , not only to develop new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , we received the information from the Pres@@ idential Committee of Karlsruhe that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500,000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community sensation . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area created ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , such as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area any interest exists to renov@@ ate .
&quot; if necessary , the area limits could then be moved again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel were represented on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; in which the renovation would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
&quot; finally , the restructuring area would eventually be set as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
the grant period for funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however , until September this year , the survey would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the restructuring area to fill a questionn@@ aire to fill out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the punc@@ tu@@ ation deadline shall be carried out in order to start with the renovation in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality must carry out the predicted preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of evaluating and deciding , when san@@ itation is being remedi@@ ed , and to what extent . &quot;
a san@@ itation mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the ground book will then be registered for the respective property .
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ tivities and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the refur@@ bishment work . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating sheet &quot; can only be filled out if premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it should be noted that Got@@ zel definitely pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes first . &quot;
one cannot reserve the subsidies for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ shake . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partn@@ ered with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm . &quot;
the fees of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that empha@@ sizes American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military service , which has been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was displayed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man &apos;s car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary arrangement or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy naval commander of aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground while the plane was on the ground . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was called the official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to contain government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said Vice President of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to de@@ duct the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idency support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers did not exceed the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget desig@@ nations for the Pres@@ idency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to hourly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things produced in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and cul@@ tured with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
&quot; at the top of the second tennis league , Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV is joining the championship . &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tob@@ acco Round of Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
&quot; despite after five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leading edge of the second tennis league has given the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; just on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV , mainly the imports from the high North . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be hard for us as always . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment of the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man not for the Bundes@@ liga team , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Republic Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first time in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Weiß@@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski and at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories against the club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ res . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening , under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , the congress gave a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is intended to pun@@ ish European corporations which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are concerned with the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea region North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ cu@@ li@@ sse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions with an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could ab@@ stain and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is the center of attention in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the eas@@ ers three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian criminal prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld took over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the professional field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
bo@@ iled will continue outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh cooled refriger@@ ated .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld district of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for 45 weekly hours , in the C@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service starting September 1 : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the size - there are two groups , just like seventy @-@ group equipment - decide on the hour circum@@ ference . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ ing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it is about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen bag to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the C@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita spaces - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical solution for the city , from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours rise not so strongly with around 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to run in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have released threats against an election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition of international fighting actions to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men try to ex@@ terminate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men at the age of 19 and 23 are expected to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who took up with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the phone of the girl . &quot;
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to grasp the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , however , which was ab@@ used . &quot;
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the Inves@@ tig@@ ations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glasgow
a union would like to wi@@ pe out the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was weighing over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; first to experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insi@@ sted on &quot; concerns that the financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to that since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our businesses - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona have been warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world has been warned about this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
&quot; when Manchester City won interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers over@@ thrown and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has deliberately turned one in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 sco@@ ot@@ ers and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle subject to damage of more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information . &quot;
&quot; to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he had a car on his track , the driver had to turn off a VW Tour@@ an and touched the console . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au there was a car in front of him , so that he had to leave to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the tour operator touched the console . &quot;
the car arose as material damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident . &quot;
it may be good according to the accident s@@ worn that the cycli@@ cal driver had not noticed the accident at all .
&quot; the police now ask witnesses to the incident , as well as the driver of the perpet@@ r@@ ator , to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases bur@@ dened by Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he was expecting from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the domain @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; &quot; that would be punished and prevented in future ; however , the &quot; &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fres@@ her .
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical remedy &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 dome @-@ scra@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be observed that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , explains in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence of Refu@@ ge@@ es at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became tangible for the latter , when a domain was musi@@ cally not a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger may be found at all . &quot;
he is just dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to experience too late or not have taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents , as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y and &quot; always enc@@ amp@@ aged by children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to w@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; that he not only kn@@ elt with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also drag@@ ged and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is about in this report , namely the dism@@ al sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , that is true Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many of the media rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him yet still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the subject abuse was reported in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also have any involvement or complic@@ ity in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if not even entrusted to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the scra@@ pe @-@ scra@@ per student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student formulated it in such a way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have been the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ sts have inv@@ aded more intru@@ sive or more clear or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report says to the very clear outcome : &quot; that the students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be acqu@@ itted by any co @-@ crew . &quot;
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violence @-@ exc@@ esses &quot; was to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; watching the road &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in the coverage of everything mixed and mixed with a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is exactly what is mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , it is kept clean : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible investig@@ ational education , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic and were app@@ alling , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first , when they were already on the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in this way , as most of the witnesses point out , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report con@@ cludes that &quot; many victims &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger rigor@@ ously tigh@@ ten the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , in the pre @-@ school , the test sentence will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria for a long time . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows yet . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing penalty was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said , it is unfair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we have historians talk about the &quot; fall of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of the past , according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
then the prin@@ cess has been right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
&quot; this is all horri@@ ble , and I &apos;m glad that it is finally being worked out . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , so to put ears and ears on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Rain@@ s@@ burger time has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of investig@@ ational death also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen did only play a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not know by no means that he carried out a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys are no longer a great singer and every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one could not imagine that he could not do anything . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former dom@@ es@@ icles still today , 23 years after his emig@@ ration , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
