<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"a Irren-Anstalt, where young people meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where it is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to be upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the big picture postcard became more detailed maps, so-called" "judge" "cards for towns and communities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops attacked the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the present-day neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide area of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische verification administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original piece of composition for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: while the Hineinzooming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called" original recording "from which the property was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no longer farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the north of sub-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, in the area of the present area Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or from the height" On the air "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfield road, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and for example ended the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the prison."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, it was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in the Munich Salesianum meet."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in architectural borrowing of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, was destroyed by bombing attacks during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the" "Kaufingerstraße" "was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the bombs of the Allies broke into the inner city.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where this day was the preparation and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony took place for the second S-Bahn branch."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for colored men, who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State Missouri, which will enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur lately throughout the state and be noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to release date warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped or killed because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline and was taken custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recently published report of the Missouri General Prosecutor's office in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be prepared if they bring Caution money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have implemented the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher pasture project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The representatives of the CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have shown themselves on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"in the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many kittens and is accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative commercialization way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the" "electric fence project" "as" "elementary importance." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"grassland area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project, and is happy with the support of leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers should be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the closing area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs totaled EUR 71 500, half of the population was promoted, a quarter contributed to the village of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job without farmers and landwomen."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss stood firm," "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a material drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be economical (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence around 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the fisherman's turnout project 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the exposure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president on the dramatic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked her meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained:" I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who yearns to breathe freely, the elongating waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around America's importance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in an unused classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great screaming of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not invading anyone but rather an early Neocclad, bringing the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh was hit by something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lodges Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Schotten belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Power Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Championship Series" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland has developed something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"your capitaine talk was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally gathered were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medallists, who compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman who was to be seen after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athlete, athletes, who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete there, and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public ministry if you cannot tolerate the fate of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he chimplied with the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will be led to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted entries of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union did not complain about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary haggle.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum which is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Minister Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers, or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassertive, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the Comments section "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor described as" "concentrated spam attack" "would call others" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical notes and to arrest and silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County won the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she called a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, on Sunday 16th July, at 4.30pm, a serenade is invited."</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius site a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village small gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Urcustomer Book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the abbey church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document, according to the document stood on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as described in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the village image of Tumlingen, the" "Berg" "is the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps out of time around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, occupied and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Bigger of the two barges on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692 but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648), the windows were cut and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camp near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they broke out the pulpit and church chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Graveyard served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm broke the steeple and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care about the" "Schaffhausen Rentner" "as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens are invited on Sunday 16th July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is arranged by the combo of the Kepler high school Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local Hartmut Romann speaks the foreword.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers set out the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility that is of importance for tumblers and auditors.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim defends itself" "does not look any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" Boisheim, "has been prompted by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration area, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">These zones should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette for a few days before, but it had not approved Düsseldorf's district government because of a molded missile."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore rejected," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again decided the wind-concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a approval by the district government still stands out."</seg>

<seg id="516">"the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Viersen for past week," declared a spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it for the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they are probably not leading to the fact that the procedure is stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reasoning of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area at the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"already last year, the company in which the town Viersen contributed indirectly, lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-inhabitants households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen Stadhaus gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Linnich Windpark near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="640">"they all have experienced Georgias for almost eight hours, when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys."</seg>
<seg id="641">"until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote but now, if one stands on the same land where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels dispensed."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead body."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the breastfeeding bodies and whispers together."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later the train will be extended by train.</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first round of the season Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result also, because not the two adversaries were at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two adversaries too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">In the Ore Mountains the triple-chain should be further optimized.</seg>

<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better in preparing with the triple quill than with the quill.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just in the triple-bet on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Castelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can speak after a draw from a misled start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could indeed be okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we can stay on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I only judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, only because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely for an accident. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 percentages where they are currently standing," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday into the encounter at last, at last (almost) finished stadium by Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we have to sweep them, just because we have the right to come under the first six, is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which must be beat in advance," "explains Fortunas chief coach."</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun to carry out tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take more exact estimation of age after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees, which were minor years."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion that the person may be "possibly under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Goransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases to suggest that the accommodated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet adjourned the 581 results, she discovered that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year."</seg>

<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>

<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is negligible. "</seg>

<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the executive organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make money loose, so that Neymar sign and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the vast ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they must interact with legitimate revenue sources, which allow them the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then powerfully invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will amplify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the deposit sum for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements."</seg>

<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlook their financial supervision by raising their income through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassador will be easy to find out for the UEFA regulators.</seg>

<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible."</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline will rewrite the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott also confirmed on request of the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"with the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the spokesperson. "</seg>
<seg id="1165">"around 17 million small red-white soggillboards, packed with 14 grams, distribute the flight attendants in front of landing to the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insider appreciates the volume of orders according to" "Nordwestschweiz" "to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros-subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a jog manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">"like many applicants, Swiss does not want to betray Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the agreement over the spring 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="1173">"since 2006, Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights."</seg>
<seg id="1174">"before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug."</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80-year-era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the sketch comedy" "The State" "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"but as a franchise, it feels like the time would be scarce."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained a original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by sticking on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children, who will grow - nevertheless they managed to win the last part of the Witzes."</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults playing adults now, is less emotionally uprooted and his parody goes more after the foundational principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-s as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Does the Cradle"). "</seg>
<seg id="1190">"at one point a character is rummaging by an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. "</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now romanesque, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"and there is another crazy malicious plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black)."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart from" Singles, "whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"these are the moments of random madness that could provoke this franchise:" Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, "whose last scene will show the film premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"in the meantime, Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring combat iconography. "</seg>
<seg id="1199">"the comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director specifies to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism."</seg>
<seg id="1200">"the main roles - a hard-minded Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronised in English."</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent play 'Find the voice'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But Comrade Detective "gets involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it is often played like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was remitted to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devoured a bunch of hamburgers. "</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a success.</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were scrutinized, as the public prosecutor insisted on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand Euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested in the same raids in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 police officers were in use."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia's members are accused of organised criminality, heavy acts of violence, murder and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor has established Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the south-German area."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1232">The data is thus managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 at 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue to rise to almost 3% in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to grow the inflation of the Brexit, and she said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>

<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it is now expected that they will make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to affect consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for cooling down inflation and a" somewhat greater "extent than the markets are expected."</seg>

<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot be avoided in the coming years," but she added that wages to the end of her three-year prognosis will be "" clear "." "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the plea.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank has said that this was expected and will be re-tightened over the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bank said that the exceedance of 2% to its goal was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montbris, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" "in the light of recent swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle before the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that prior to the sexual intercourse preexpositional prophylaxis (prep) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, now comes from health service to a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prep) prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV agents that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants are identified in clinics that will agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a GP may also opt-in to participate in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the total potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used specifically, absorbed and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention was to supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is yet another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive on NAT (National Aids Trust) said," This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>

<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one, who has a risk of HIV, is left behind."</seg>

<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bank manager with a passion for real estate, made a big house in Knightsbridge at Earls Court Apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlapping, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other without having to pick us up.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to function longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the Cutlery and Glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is always important, so when you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to increase the surface area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love you in electric power sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square meteroom of somewhat standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an analysis of one of the biggest real estate empire of Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their capacity should be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with senior employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media device."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Kandidat Trump has been annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," said the ex-election consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter's custom was ever" under control, "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials don't know what we don't know others - that Trumps tweets would have included even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never find out about the tweets that trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his colleagues managed to keep it away from him a couple of times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from causing trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, who are composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the advisors of the advisers to induce doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a vulcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that happened at the end of February when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy commander Katie Walsh," "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter due to chicans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisers still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were kicked out in May, without being deterred by a ditch digged by the Council in order to prevent their seizures."</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry people attacked the council of Solihull, who said that it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Operation Company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered to the governor's office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented placing asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time by serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof already have long time construction-shuttle in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovations will be made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"floors were torn out, blankets are partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do in March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," "says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "beautiful bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer puts it."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a gem." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a upscale city level, Scherer emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB-Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer wants not to specify exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just below a million euros, it pays off."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace which is open to the restaurant, which is open to public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us-Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller asked for a report to a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the broadcaster CNN reported, there are already the first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men who acted in the election campaign as advisers of the republicist."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "signed a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump sums up personally into the centre and investigate whether the president may have impeded the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible interruptions and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the charges of charges.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for the hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the broadcaster CNN, pre-invitations were exhibited that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. also Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his wife Paul Manafort, were involved in the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the substitution show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he, if necessary, wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charges of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"amid the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI director James Comey told three times that not to be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have been noisy, he refused to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to suspend the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The solved speculation about whether trump mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent Special Investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislative bodies on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg accelerates in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a giant iceberg has solved itself from the Schelfeis by just about seven times."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus spread over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, research is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factorial background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colony was so far a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and cracking was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete chess puzzle is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"it's a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze the ice so much water as it results after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the horseshoe causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in small dimensions, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest Schelfeis of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and no direct link to climate change is aware of, the iron sign comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "Our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"although these scientists do not cause the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic peninsula have fallen in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long summit of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the polar surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore ranks among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for transverse climbers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is from a" "real" "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees, who have disease or age-related reasons, come from the service."</seg>

<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in an opinion to the social media. "</seg>

<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected to overtake over the authority of the Italian Coastal Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities."</seg>

<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in future, sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through wind and weather over the stadium arcades?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">We have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and at the end of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>

<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the German Association to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the e-sport computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even the soccer simulation FIFA are being fought at competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and at the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certain to be used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport, because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactivity."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Witte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobber also sees problems:" doping is becoming more and more a topic. "</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform when playing online and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, which is like a big global family, because there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) precedes the e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales at 130 million are expected to lie in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already moving forward.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the Bundesliga clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an E-Sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany lags behind," explains VfB-Executive Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to fall, and to clarify the old times, is no longer sufficient today."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years were exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced to life in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward directed eyes when she was sentenced."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She ended his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has shown no remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "awful circumstance that it completely deplores." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their" old or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A Prosecutor was reading a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy who complained that there was "no day in which I don't feel the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I interact with everything. I try, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, stated that she is" "persecuted" "by the realization that she will never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person, with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts making it a crime to claim another suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters had revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, refresh yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is turn off the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was asked by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the fall by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy, before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not in prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kim was working in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm into the hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the unwanted troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the look for the whole, while many others were occupied with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus, to overplay his missing fitness (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches thus, to join the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia journey (also limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle thus, in their first appearance in the Bavaria Trikot would not be negative."</seg>

<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were in 2009 the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominals range."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico's chaos dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest break from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken up his office in December 2012. 589 have been under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of killers linked to drug trafficking each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting about security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times it was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with the" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But in Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in January last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug royal which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez had become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez to fail, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without hitting smoking, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be able to publish hard meetings without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take on the task that runs as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel that could fluke like a dockworker, a friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space in which the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no phones allowed. days before was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-range neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who described the governor himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodosia has printed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled nearly the whole century all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez were regarded as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken up with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was devoted to storage space for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by having written in organised protests" SOS Press "on sidewalks and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has then requested that she is once again divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, the government officials involved and a" "uniform society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note, supposedly signed by Zetas Kartell," "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, indicates that the drug trade is frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer, as at once all their phones began to summon."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with taperival and security forces near the Mazatlan beach had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"the war escalated, as promised by a series of Kartell embassies in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the onboard edge you published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heulls nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez gave a look at the police officers holding the guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as you can only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used cloaking to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable rashort of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said, it would have had something of a" restless past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" "Current Biology" "described it as" "the padded dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur items in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of nodossiers, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has researchers who describe it as" "truly remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy Erdklush."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you smile just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur examples - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this herbivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a wall-changing tank, was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to interfere better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the Museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shadings are common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur chased enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs to promote the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the shade - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodosr was subjected to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur showing how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal based on his life, including his conserved Darminate, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodoso is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaur standing on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the padded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the average creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inches long lace shaved by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater heritage of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so good that the skin-bar still covers hollowed armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Hidden remnants of the skin still cover the fetched armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no information about the exact number of publishers."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was easy to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large amount of bailout vehicles was at the accident point.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long regression was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as reported by a AZ reporter, there was also on the counter-road to massive disabilities - with numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notched the hallmarks of the vehicle manufacturers who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 6: 45 p.m. there was another accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: mufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and awakens an unsanted or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn currently tests the wireless ticket inspection.</seg>

<seg id="1995">"currently, testing runs on two lines."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer arrives, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a rail spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" is the rail the ticket devaluation without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have bought it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" Comfort check-in "works so that one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers then a button for electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"the train companion at the ticket control at number Y knows, that there is a passenger with already validated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can go on to sleep, continue to keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" Check-in "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel without ticket control through our train staff, check in the DB navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to personalize their journey time in the train," "says Michael Peterson, marketing executive board of DB Fernverkehr."</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often drives the train, knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket inspections belong to the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"often you have, in any case, one of the contributors not all the documents you need to degrade online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the identity card, or otherwise a document you have to prove."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time takes care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police band and people crying, and from a man claiming to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman escaped his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "Conrell recalled their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the people's point of view who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had numerous times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I was lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any eccentric racism, she is not different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"they prepared bags, and helped to pass them on to demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black churches. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "record" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often of whites - in a community profited by their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years following Brown's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferral's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah guide, but a community, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferral's life, as she falls in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the movie" BlackLivesMatter "in social media after killing the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," and we are constantly fighting on various fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - besides our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while they say one to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a man "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalena! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which also the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of construction, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda Square, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher shop we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">This should probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's a shopping paradise in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"sorry, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer's market be present during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it create the ghost bit gallery before, selling all stores from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - no place for senseless construction projects in Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable resemblance: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The thirty portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst claimed a 35-year sentence after she publicly criticised the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking Dissieur, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomical data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, openly condemned as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013, among them six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which panning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blond - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts like cigarette dumplings and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">She couldn't be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse became an unequal Brieffecond who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which predict a future in which the president would turn to Chelseas's verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, man's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"even now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths, in order to inflame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature among them (the" i "in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, said Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a free talk phone.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they speak your speech, then they have won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I always get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"panning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was supposed to be taken away in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks from their own genomic simulacras, which are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5", "Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement which also stuck behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who were chosen as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56), arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as reported by Cook County's Local Court."</seg>

<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority was that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem now have been rated and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them, reinforce," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said, it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras have been confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the doping approved by the WADA by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups to handle employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to handle the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>

<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that were formerly hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship can be identified quicker and addressed."</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2260">It goes on 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers are talking on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved out their tricot tops and show their back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break."</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the water sport center next morning at 6: 30 am.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real trek for the guys," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday to Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood executed practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are to hold 18 exercises during the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said he supported NCAA's regime change even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said. "</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply pushed it, they placches on, they are great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it's really great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will end their practice as soon as the camp is over, resulting in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of upscale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a torpost, no easy task will be."</seg>

<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," Mora said. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to immerse on a broader basis into English history, including 'The Labourer' that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>

<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan insisted on the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be even crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, thereby choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the" "personalities" "that would make a steppe-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing to them, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "who conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxGold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the Website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one step up to Frigid (means here: opposing) Farrah is concerned, disturb one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxes with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxxy?" "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement point to a somewhat darker and lowering in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what escapes from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain exaggeration that these highly developed sex robots abound in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has chosen to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the devoured body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are faint slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the way of speech by 2017: maid</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them including republican kinship, with whom they struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar to the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"the dining table is certainly a good thing, but it's in another context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the gruselic possibility that his kittens will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as very mild criminal offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when trump comes, the next candidate of the republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carousel of the New York City Park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormously big, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals turn out to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climating music puts this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London."</seg>
<seg id="2443">"however, Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, since two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bloats, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person affected is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been established that a kind of tolerance fostering the immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said," We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet that rich in tryptophan contributes to a more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel metabolism if the same system also causes people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, this did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiases of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of mice were sequenced DNA sequencers and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained from L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">High tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," "the deputy commander answered."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was called the official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters for the event."</seg>

<seg id="2901">"author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "Mein Bruder of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 dome-scrapes."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be observed that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, explains in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence of Violence of Refugees at the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became tangible for the latter, when a domain was musically not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger may be found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to reproach him, to experience too late or not have taken the first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents, as literally" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony," sincerely, "" sincerely, "" sincerely, "" sincerely, "" competent "and" understanding "as an extremely good-natured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always encampaged by children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to wutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also dragged and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is about in this report, namely the dismal sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, that is true Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is a question of whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many of the media rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him yet still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the subject abuse was reported in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also have any involvement or complicity in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the sufferers for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if not even entrusted to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scrape-scraper student Ratzinger's role in relation to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student formulated it in such a way: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have been the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd, to assume that... Busts have invaded more intrusive or more clear or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report says to the very clear outcome:" that the students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted by any co-crew."</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violence-excesses "was to be read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "watching the road". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in the coverage of everything mixed and mixed with a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is kept clean: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible investigational education, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally schizophrenic and were appalling, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first, when they were already on the secondary school gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in this way, as most of the witnesses point out, the subject of" primary school "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the secondary school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims "estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the reproach remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger rigorously tighten the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymnasium, which even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that, in the pre-school, the test sentence will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said, it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time of the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we have historians talk about the" fall of Anachronism, "that is, the danger of the past, according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and not for what was banned in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all horrible, and I'm glad that it is finally being worked out."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, so to put ears and ears on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Rainsburger time has played Georg Ratzinger for the talks with you for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of investigational death also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Domspatzen did only play a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not know by no means that he carried out a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, the rebellious boys are no longer a great singer and every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartfelt people, from which one could not imagine that he could not do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former domesicles still today, 23 years after his emigration, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable disrespectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the starting point would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
