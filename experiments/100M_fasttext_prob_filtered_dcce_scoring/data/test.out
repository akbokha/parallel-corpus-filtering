28 @-@ year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally he went up with him again . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , divided the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , held his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed &quot; &quot; and destroyed at the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone , who would harm his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; connecting his way to his family was to always cook something to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , which lit every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the Hin@@ dered Wag@@ on of the SF@@ PD under the 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I am always plug@@ ged into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I am always plug@@ ged into drawers or bonded from outside label , which with me and reality mostly have little to do . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cos@@ mop@@ olitan area .
&quot; the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of TV with casual Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the glu@@ t she asks the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is an all @-@ cat@@ chy mother of two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked for a bit di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and that ended the riding career as well .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - was once again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself be guided with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not even for photography purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport assistant presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Gol@@ dene sports pyramid .
to awards do not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lor@@ rant , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ mired him .
long is the 18th W@@ inner of the Sports Pyram@@ id .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US Champion winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ aner , the founder Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ st@@ adion where the Lav@@ azza award went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept far distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreement T@@ TP - they want Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt small and war@@ ns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
&quot; Clinton wanted to tax@@ ing the economy to death and regulate his death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw from regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton on the other hand says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has privileged opportunities to open and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost the same . &quot;
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly forbidden by the state @-@ critical te@@ amm@@ y @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump we could even come across party discussions .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive the coal mining in the USA again .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to quit . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better then , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wages .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump in this question is to do is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage does not have to be changed , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her little son into his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen were p@@ lowed .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
it has long been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they thre@@ aten politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a bear@@ er of hope . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tractors require a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , er@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single @-@ standing women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this results in roughly 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich , who are trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich , some with no answer . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is something like in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , the fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia , there are some common shel@@ ters or own houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be kept separate from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protective need , one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance Veter@@ in@@ arians : demands for new employment measures
Deputy of the Assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns for their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has required its entire council to appro@@ ve more work activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re @-@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has today provided a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating working campaigns that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in the fact that assist@@ ants of this year strike six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the leader of the B@@ MA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would inevitably be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of the words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed st@@ alli@@ ed , and he hardly breath@@ ed heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was floo@@ ded .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was made by a presum@@ ed friend . &quot;
to re@@ build the ve@@ en becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most seriously , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials were that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in territories of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President Erd@@ og@@ an who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after having been enth@@ r@@ alled by a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ time rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti summar@@ ized it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as it was his response to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ vot@@ al to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; &quot; alliance of external leaders &quot; &quot; : two countries that refra@@ in from the West and are badly treated and are now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey explained it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank CEO , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all the RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange quot@@ ations will be changed to Nat@@ alie . &quot;
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail banking that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched those brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings about 3,@@ 000@@ th gains &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori grab@@ s the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone only few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect , which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ y jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in GB what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British surface for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ re@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his top form . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue on competitions until his at least 50.@@ 50 years of life .
Russian Putin feu@@ ds Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est vote of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a special commission@@ er for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Vice President since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the protocol chief and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as a head of state , regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ations and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff reti@@ res at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is here the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who was once praised as a potential president , at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - hit large scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust me for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;

criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after winning producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement its dism@@ iss@@ al .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , which one can only wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
&quot; puzzles for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff &quot;
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff demanded assistance in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sand@@ als that were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in hopes that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross dres@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing arguments of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Kei@@ th Brown &apos;s Minister of Economy took a visit today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all the witnesses of a truly epic project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge @-@ deck are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and deep @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last street cover and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north side or the landing page . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate work .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; hei@@ r , as the toler@@ ances for which the team were working , were tiny - on each side they are only a few millimeters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck &quot; to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; to be alive after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI emergency station struck Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty walking in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they were all aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , were lucky to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this sol@@ dered by the person who controls the boat at the bottom of the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
hard hurt - man sti@@ cking on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic cul@@ pri@@ t cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed became the sister of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road she met the man &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sent his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action plan &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot;
but contro@@ versy is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann , president of the SPD : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable homes can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of the flats as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing funding programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , will ensure incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
&quot; regardless of that , so Brat@@ man , flag himself a sharp@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 affordable housing that will take place in the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , as the planning @-@ planning spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought @-@ out bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one stroke , the problem can be solved . &quot;
because in the West@@ stadt run for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West city is increased dramatically , one removes oneself from the goal of so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time resting on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) were created . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the che@@ ek and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a si@@ zable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5,000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently , that within two days after launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
anyone who drives sport regularly reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ es spo@@ ils that must always compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has occurred a breakthrough .
&quot; even when smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity before , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be saved with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam@@ entur@@ er
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now finally also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday became the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly presented in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; teams by A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ battle of women in the gymn@@ asi@@ um during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
&quot; this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ martial arts at the Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as a call@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , while their long way to the top , never planned to have planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a training flight into the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turns , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
floating beams and floor foun@@ tains - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title title - lou@@ der .
&quot; she repeated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam , and put on it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she strug@@ gl@@ ed around the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her cultivation practice she threw the audience K@@ us@@ h@@ onen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in case of serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks since they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and injured two more . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which dropped on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ mice and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of its age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let go of it .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , it was abandoned , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor scrat@@ ch@@ ke up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign that Ed@@ mund had planned for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund had invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the with the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know yet .
I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I do not expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ds cause b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to sh@@ out the emergency room on Friday . it is expected the whole satur@@ day over with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds to extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards agreed that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , said that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ites near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably be reached after the weekend of record level . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the represented rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still t@@ apped people from floo@@ ds in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose heavily overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ child who lives nearby had warned him .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flow@@ ed and flowing in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities could consider ev@@ ac@@ uation directives . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer held near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been dras@@ tically weigh@@ ed through the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a cor@@ ridor in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed by floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ds and sand bags were provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and businesses . &quot;
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but on Friday they have not been reported . &quot;
&quot; Kei@@ th Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police told me that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at the hospital during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was enriched by spheres , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reported the station . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether one of the injured men could find the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a camp@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were tubes . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; said police det@@ achment Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently reports the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse bat on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ as@@ tics , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin @-@ color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic , completes , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic @-@ female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one under the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America ju@@ bel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion@@ ships Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were expecting unexpected , but master@@ ly gi@@ ym@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won Gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so exercise classes in the whole country do not look out . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to get it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gymn@@ asts are expensive sport and tur@@ ner first and foremost in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , furnishing , travel , clothing , competitive and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and family ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to au@@ n the municipalities of numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize other strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 doctors who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt &apos;s plans were un@@ veiled to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be dam@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ happy times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Kom@@ mid@@ ee for assistance doctors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have to deal with the proposed contract , in particular that it will heal the current workforce and it will be administered to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve the disputes by discussions sti@@ cking to the government for ref@@ using to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made over the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to raise the suspension and address the concerns of the ants .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors on the strip post @-@ chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , urged the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing but little , but burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have talked to the committee of the Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training courses , training courses , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ pro daily medication that can lower heart rate risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ pro Day medication after being advised by the authorities to meet this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the NI@@ CE regulation of N@@ HS recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE regulation of N@@ HS recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies causing floor@@ ings .
&quot; when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ ur the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Sciences Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ino is effectively in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stroke attacks in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; with a provisional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ino - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the re@@ aring design does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness str@@ ils election fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
&quot; a culture of political cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that far @-@ spread poll@@ ing fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , as a crus@@ hing government report today disclosed . &quot;
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles verb@@ ally attacks the police , elec@@ tive ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of elec@@ tive abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who now is an anti @-@ corruption affair , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger , if they submit their vote to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demanded that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves electoral fraud but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial asset culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be dismis@@ sed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia in@@ alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which one person cho@@ oses another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guide of evidence to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; the evidence was attached to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ ian background . &quot;
there were concerns ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity related to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists manipul@@ ate brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; &quot; harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list of immigrants and social bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic stamp .
ban on political activists to process full correspondence and envel@@ opes of stamps .
police have the authority to set up lock @-@ off stations .
amend@@ ment of a bill made easier for the prosecution of inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photography offered in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the bal@@ lot stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually prevail that voters alone go to the electoral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; crash checks &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the Mother of Parliament , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of the French bi@@ kers Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot who proved to be the impressive double @-@ fle@@ ece of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only Ath@@ l@@ ete that has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can give faith to the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , who currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics , which show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous thei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the bicycle track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes shall be able to go through the Cu@@ ban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one ais@@ le higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress
&quot; another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who is similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal floating in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : foot@@ ball@@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ner Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own wonderful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died like a pig

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese floating in &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief went off &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he was at the end of the 4x@@ 200m hands @-@ free s@@ wimm@@ ers to leave his own opinions .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as he called M@@ ief , he died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating aff@@ s 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted quickly after they were shock@@ ed by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ et , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year old Flo@@ at from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m hands @-@ in swimming arm for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which he asked him many questions . &quot;
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how uncomfortable B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # sh@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; We are sorry that the comment was broadcast on a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the comment @-@ script Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it was broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended , and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered , as she saw in it , she pulled out and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before putting them back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she came back and left the business without buying something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out their own tr@@ ump pants and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her did nothing to go back and out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone to think - or think about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; as disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if one approaches you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike it with your knees in the bar and twist while the att@@ acker is cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; for att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and strike the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but keep in mind that it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - if you are not a mad@@ man mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ist for a guide to his tongue at the most dirty places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and Wür@@ z@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - by removing some of the dir@@ t@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a Euro scarf , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a ban@@ deau top of a tie toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before placing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of det@@ ecting the flus@@ hing button of a tie toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set up its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test coating showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to det@@ ra@@ ct after its L@@ umin@@ ometer was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I will not lick here anything here , because it is inside disgu@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them , they tick and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ement social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ement with a damage of £ 50,000 because it had terror@@ ised its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ illustrated cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being rolled away from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were ring@@ ing holes , wood panels were pil@@ ed up , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , included street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all ra@@ ckets , inti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ ams , strikes and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ ings were bitten . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street , and the police had to be inv@@ oked on a regular basis . &quot;
Corn@@ wall housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ement were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They stro@@ ve for no one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that it fo@@ amed the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ement is always the last step that Corn@@ wall Housing is taking into account . &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be considered terrible for their neighbors .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously gone to us and have given us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors , and the message convey@@ s that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ement on the ground .
workers of the house administration will now have to be fo@@ aming rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ et@@ ons received a fine of money after she ple@@ aded guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in trade .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are del@@ oo@@ zing r@@ enters who do not adhere to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police told that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an effective military jet flying over
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air strikes put an unbelievable crash
&quot; the air strikes gave that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
&quot; this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a flying jet over@@ threw over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sun @-@ wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing , and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were panic when the plane came out of the dark and unbeliev@@ ably deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , so that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was slightly lower than usual due to bad visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland where four people were killed on Madeira Island . &quot;
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which limits his point of view
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

&quot; before the first match of the new season , the Spanish Master gives doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ gi@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince . &quot;

MA Long in your own league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; with this the World Ran@@ king First won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick the single title in the character of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their guns on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches , until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang was tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were awarded with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
MA had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he determined the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma was not the expected comp@@ elling match .
&quot; nevertheless , however , sufficient breathtaking ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ oc@@ ani won the bronze medal against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Weiß@@ rus@@ se had contrac@@ ted a ri@@ b @-@ injury , was afterwards in a medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to settle with lead . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump sums up ″ Great Problems ″ in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states , losing their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp , the doubt about his success in the fight for the White House is growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of Evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame for false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ rou@@ d . &quot;
republi@@ can high@@ lands w@@ ack@@ ers
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he makes nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened tr@@ ump to strike funds for supporting his campaign , he should not be able to present better surveys . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans for Congress should be stronger than their arms . &quot;
Olympics : tri@@ ster Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened by the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , delivered a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ yan of the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association adopted the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to comply with its own investigations by an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; according to the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released the sample and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the athletes who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ fourth more than 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Red had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is to be informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has long been under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing attempts .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio games , the athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into vis@@ as . &quot;
the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a major runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were raised repeatedly that dop@@ ing funds are readily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sport dec@@ eption . &quot;
&quot; at last , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had recru@@ ited them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type area @-@ covering and systematically mut@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic car , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a night@@ mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly to her favorite with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , which I as Roman &quot; , &quot; regards Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London school girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year in order to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was sev@@ ent@@ een years old and died after her family according to her family , shortly after she had to leave the war @-@ captured land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from East London moved to Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ anas &apos;s family has been told that she married an IS@@ IS fighters in Syria , and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow . &quot;
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will be the candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate Mr. Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d said later that he hadn &apos;t spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , re@@ public@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ per workers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants naked calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works together with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school &apos;s play@@ boys is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish@@ able as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the opinion that it does the Calendar . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects mass ex@@ odus
&quot; those who do not fit and praise Erd@@ og@@ an sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; said the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard rise of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted coup , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime further comb@@ ats the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already over@@ loaded Kur@@ dish bur@@ sts with fac@@ tions before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are on the run within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the commander compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the reis@@ su@@ e on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
the President demanded that the German government positions itself as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters .
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ists , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all considered eligible candidates ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than so far , it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and country elections - this bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the milit@@ ants , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the holiday makers , who are in the country , on the island of Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of voices , only to apply lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to leave election campaign close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition break@@ age .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it did his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes election campaign . &quot;
she invited Angela Merkel two @-@ time ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag group is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual electoral conditions on market places and shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country it is the basis that she needs to be very strict about finding a wire to the people .
&quot; you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any of the country &apos;s expan@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hurt , namely , where people are : dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election in 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party , with seven percent in the poll@@ s , must make the leap into the country &apos;s parliament . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and place their campaign mainly on the Internet .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on trace search for native stimul@@ ants among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to compl@@ ain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those who are responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end at 8@@ pm , there are praise everywhere . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; the decision will also be given to those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to setting up housing trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been revers@@ ed and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg exists , the traffic situation within the place was relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now continue on both sides by O@@ fter@@ dingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asi@@ veness through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the deputy head leader Florian King for the transport @-@ related management of the refur@@ bishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eks were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ k in residential areas .
&quot; as also the speed limits have not been observed , the congregation reinforced the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself spot on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been bl@@ ur@@ red .
the quick@@ est way was with 77 kilometers of kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site is gone , however , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 rest@@ au@@ ration has led to revenue streams , everyone you ask is to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also states that &quot; &quot; the drive is missing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most crowded are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 per cent &quot; , &quot; the sales revenue figures rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road &quot; &quot; Straß@@ ens@@ nar@@ rowing &quot; &quot; has left its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint , the host@@ ess would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it has to bear the disadvantages inherent in the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER white from other coun@@ ties , where such a generous deal has been handled . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now see less frequently because of the complicated traffic flow , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that his tribal hit returns after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of terrorist fighting , it is constantly screw@@ ed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the labor@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ call anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I in@@ stru@@ ct myself . &quot;
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , however , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to leave before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already announced , announced , said , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines for passenger information and tru@@ ce rights .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second startup for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty , and squ@@ ad ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still considers this to be reasonable and does not require any chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have in part in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a safety verification .
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some of them still works un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated and is open to questions .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg refugees were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that people deeply occupy , let themselves not be cl@@ amped in electoral periods . &quot;
the inner security is enorm@@ ously highlighted in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in a position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it was high between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a military dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister of Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ans are also demanding a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling for con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he thinks nothing . &quot;
we have been speaking about the discussion in Germany .
making it new is not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own parcel is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in it that could ensure a fight .
&quot; however , even the SPD is trying to pro@@ long itself on the topic of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ shei@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel only sign@@ alizes caution and says , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
Volkswagen is still off lightly .
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running around .
&quot; in the call @-@ back reaction , there is a vor@@ tex about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen bo@@ unces deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can further demonstrate a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the brand @-@ brand VW was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus again weigh@@ ed the total sales as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year &apos;s month in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; only in Western Europe , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries rose by almost a six @-@ hund@@ red@@ th . &quot;
market sales chief Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a sales restra@@ int in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was bur@@ dened by the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus of beech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mostly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony already got off lightly through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an output minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler could advance sales plans from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , worldwide 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been tam@@ pered with with a software check @-@ out .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW was re@@ affir@@ ming that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car manufacturer present a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate to the customer after the conversion , but I am not talking about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason are j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal fin@@ eness .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now weighing up to its German customers , but now a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA .
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that no deteri@@ or@@ ations will occur in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen is using the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen can see that customers can come into a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this can be brought back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal is to ensure uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was stated . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich as@@ best@@ os in future - as second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Mr. Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who use 40 million euros on sight deposits or cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; should not be afraid to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; shift banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent pen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposits or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he has been paying 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost is now forwarded according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; to let cash go in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , much too dangerous would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four times , I don &apos;t want to see the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers would understand and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rate to other banks .
&quot; the Bavarian Association of Co @-@ oper@@ atives declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide compensation for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is somewhat lush . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it be@@ ware for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , sports@@ men and business@@ men live in the region . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ verband Bayern &quot; are currently no other banks known , which calculate a reimbur@@ sement for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not enjoy this in the width .
Dest@@ ination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men of middle ages love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section , to ski@@ p it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Not Alle@@ en@@ sam@@ en@@ Male medi@@ ator with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the manifold re@@ emergence of sound plates is not based on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely runner @-@ up group . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record purch@@ as@@ ers retain their feelings sooner ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but what are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , I &apos;ll take a humble grey suit and go wild before I ste@@ al , hold my hands and take a bit more determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - still there is a handful of fantastic record specialist shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data quantity : two young women , three men of middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data quantity : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
is he a collector ? do I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets will apply to the you@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing union of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received imp@@ etus from the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves , from objects that evoke happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff turned out from a stack of sheets . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , have not yet heard them . &quot;
&quot; the pol@@ l also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned as I flo@@ ated through a stack of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data quantity : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ ph@@ ew aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead album so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produc@@ t@@ las@@ tig , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ tig . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly coming in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ ers Pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to figure when standing next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates that are available for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more of a shop window than a big shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting tiles is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to be wearing the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most for luxury goods such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research suggests that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collector &apos;s and board lovers , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bee by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old mistaken moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of nothing crazy men of middle age . &quot;

French court ref@@ uses offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ ary transactions in which persons within the bearing goods , sell cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional dining restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and which would present fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that businesses and restaurants are important since free meals , which are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also advised that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running 72 pro@@ vis@@ ory businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp that is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite the Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin stays wei@@ rd
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and compete , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar guard .
&quot; I hon@@ estly say it was hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s drive , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyse in silence what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time F@@ WC in Qatar in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything exactly what we have changed over the last time .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ times World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed knives : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , the Temp@@ os@@ ün@@ der should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary clock speed , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ itz for maintaining the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured over multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer , you can move the trailer by car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain reco@@ vers in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold is fet@@ ched
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day Ru@@ g@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji has awarded a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympics of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the sharp defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a comfort for GB - but probably it won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost any game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. , as if one would run into moving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was r@@ ammed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ep@@ stak@@ ing T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has stopped Fi@@ ji only . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua saw a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since re @-@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kles of the GB team , stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still st@@ oned . &quot;
NT@@ F @-@ C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Head@@ master
GB led basic changes to half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans s@@ angen , pi@@ ps and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced themselves and GB kick@@ te kick@@ ed out in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer to the ru@@ dder win
there will be no motor lighter than in these games and that wants what .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the contributions that sat on the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she ru@@ sted for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without control woman , the first women in the history of the British sport , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ ter uns@@ atur@@ ated use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the way of trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that could make the difference and there was no one of me than the trainer who would not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day 30 months ago . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did .
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right concept in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ growing morning to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to coach or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let oneself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make some rab@@ bit .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water sport association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia ple@@ aded the co@@ er@@ ci@@ on association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; b@@ anded Bavarian &quot; &quot; far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert Gu@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , of which 28 years were the managing director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water sport association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually fo@@ sters about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the churches of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refur@@ bishment of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and I have always added improvements because water life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association , and he has lived in the water expe@@ dient , as if it were his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district .
for this he received very much praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller first praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well construction and re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were , however , the frac@@ ture at the high reservoir at church @-@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees it was necessary to work throughout the night so that the localities with water could be provided . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the floo@@ d@@ water reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water sport association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert Gu@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .

&quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was killed in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and injured her deadly wounded .
&quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the day @-@ to @-@ day or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
it is a child mal@@ treatment .
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command kom@@ mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens which threatened the industry from green electricity are from the table .
&quot; it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission originally planned to ask steel manufacturers to use gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the WA@@ P . there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works f@@ alle an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; with this , the status quo of the previous scheme was largely determined . &quot;
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry has special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation was further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imported import tari@@ ffs have an impact on import steel , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude closures of individual works . &quot;
&quot; around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced just six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as the steel trade association on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced crowd went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , at the teacher &apos;s degree , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
she does something good for her health and spirit .
&quot; for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most senior singers sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dis@@ solve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to listen and organize , to be able to rely on the other and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
because the elderly exercise a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
&quot; who regularly calls his lungs , even in everyday life is not so fast from the Pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia suffer@@ ers often ab@@ stain from long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just the elderly , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I have a long time for something , I become better and more alert beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , she advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears , when a sound comes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church .
many sen@@ iors can also be found over the internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cr@@ aters on the scre@@ e of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect has the Ru@@ fen of Cat @-@ bears on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ sts also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ st@@ ung of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster on lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great distress such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study published on Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; specialist magazine . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ oral scre@@ am was different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens who were additionally elevated . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; all females , even those who still had no own offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the speaker , when this calls played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski uses &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür was issued an arrest warran@@ t against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup , Turkey is again an important soccer game . &quot;
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected by the im@@ min@@ ence of the uprising in July after the uprising in July . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of being responsible for the exercise of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , even before football is not made . &quot;
the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür .
&quot; accordingly , the southern door living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ ür should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; although the initial condition imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , what the Turks pre@@ dict is the rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; it will be particularly popular again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Cologne listed his athle@@ tic value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good@@ bye to the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South per Li@@ g , it was only ranked six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at the same time , at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez sold under contract under the contract and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its European holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around a third of its estimated year of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man noted : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova won &apos;t start in Rio .
other over@@ run athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed her starting right just before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was beaten mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered a bizarre scenery : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; when determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; however , there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain relief Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , I had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
Sandra P@@ erk@@ ovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 and European Championship was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
P@@ erk@@ ovic cont@@ ested the daily intake and was barri@@ c@@ aded for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , fired merge . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ stein , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete has been det@@ ained as many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympics silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the also recognised bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was due to a verdi@@ ct from the International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTY ) .
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion@@ ships were found evidence of taking a forbidden food supplement , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA declined mil@@ de and went off on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ as injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so waste . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning again two explo@@ sions went high , and a further human being killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; at Det@@ on@@ ation near the beach , popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police declarations . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower be@@ et before the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; after all , there were several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , also Thai media wanted to see a pattern typical for the bom@@ bing of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still uncle@@ ar which group stro@@ kes behind the attacks .
&quot; the police told their officials all over the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over years by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the explo@@ ding bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces Nar@@ ay@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) gel@@ ed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody rest@@ lessness , believes himself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting the grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is in the spotlight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Executive director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ arten of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; multic@@ ult@@ i @-@ wh@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through aliens . &quot; &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ans . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ arten said , his authority was closely aligned with the state offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the chief executive director . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ s@@ ment for your own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are especially vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ans &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no findings . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with regard to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right terrorism . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ uris@@ tic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further err@@ atic group@@ ings or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shel@@ ters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or European @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ arten expressed concern that many attacks came to the account of people who did not appear before in the right @-@ hand scene .
this is the wor@@ rying factor .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had previously been politically in@@ different with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ tist , which , however , have radic@@ alized themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or World Records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV @-@ pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral interaction . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is nevertheless participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting right from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more famous .
&quot; as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; some media described him as &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in reference to a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the Aqu@@ educ@@ t from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping election defeat not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be anything with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then dri@@ fts into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be relatively un@@ bi@@ ased : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , the latter became more and more resistance . &quot;

Gf@@ K leadership occurs after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K di@@ verses his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the in@@ cis@@ ions suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Executive Board Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nürn@@ berger market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ign@@ ation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five in the industry faces a new start . &quot;
the chief executive director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
&quot; as of 1 September , the management of the Management Board will take the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ er , sharing the company with . &quot;
&quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the in@@ cis@@ ions , the company called &quot; &quot; differ@@ ing views &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; who will , in future , become the market research company , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , it was called on Friday , in the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police reported . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her data to a vice , which was partly on the opposite track . &quot;
the bus came to the right and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance trucks and a ambul@@ ance truck arrived at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the load @-@ drivers and possible witnesses to contact the police .
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of waste water will be for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( until now 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased later than once again if appropriate improvement measures are needed . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted in the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach land office that under@@ cover these wast@@ ewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot;
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Administr@@ ative Director , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calendar period can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in the event of all three wast@@ ewater facilities , Schmidt founded relatively small installations with a very low waste water intake , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution basis , for example expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refur@@ bishment and repair expenditure , they are not least incurred due to their age of refur@@ bishment and repair expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be installed after almost 20 years , the slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which have been taken into account in the new calculation period , came into account . &quot;

Stein@@ häuser made it clear that in the case of low wast@@ ewater treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully carried out .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , as one could not extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer system in order to avoid these facilities because it is a sanitary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria regi@@ sters for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % have been booked .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian carto@@ onist critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies each day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages arrive to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat @-@ Fil@@ ters have drawn criticism in which they were charged that the app Black@@ face promoted or propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and infl@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow vision . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat informed that it had disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders experienced by rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of vulnerable cli@@ ch@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and bar@@ k said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face has been pulled into the down@@ ward extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ gee .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counter@@ parts - could rather assume sensi@@ bility .
&quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was in the past , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focused on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on the spot in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Military Revolutionary Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Defence Committee , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically sent off by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com units , regularly reported a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report shows detailed hur@@ d@@ les in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts set out . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com sen@@ voy publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest may start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the peak of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to bring down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an excessive process for the preparation of intelligence ratings to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest level of Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no hint at the White House &apos;s intervention at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings were published Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported the investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , an Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Islamic State of the Islamic State commemor@@ ated the differences of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , stated that contrary to the government &apos;s declarations , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which will remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round on Saturday .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work point in London that we now have .
we have been able to plu@@ ck the helm entirely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a back handle from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India was without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and l@@ up@@ lifted the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a spe@@ edy match between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod that is passed by the w@@ rist@@ band to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coffee shop , without having to listen to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names , which would have been sent to Prime Time by sponsor@@ ing and feel @-@ TV advertising , if it would be a float , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I could make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was perceived so spar@@ ingly that many people , I had asked , did not know that it was even an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to the competition , there has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an ath@@ l@@ ete , who made it until the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds perfect for a c@@ low@@ n school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ously potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never ending colli@@ sion - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports which are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , ho@@ ver@@ ing and o@@ int@@ ages ) before they land on your feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to official Olympic program , grade , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue their pursuit of gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to finish , sometimes back and down , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ak@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is noble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears . &quot;
but it is also what I find myself when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she jumps down , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympics @-@ man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by fear and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base after air . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long one ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters who demand political change in Ethiopia came to violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that the prot@@ esters were killed during the colli@@ sions with the police in case of shot change .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot dead prot@@ esters and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ences and re @-@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of wor@@ sen@@ ing under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphone became more and more common and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ est@@ ant .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as flour@@ ished from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but that is also changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years long Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unsure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting that , according to the data of analysts , were suppos@@ edly fu@@ eled by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s leaders praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conduct of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; the last month protests in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist town , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for crow@@ ning flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ versy on Friday , which sur@@ rounds his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly reiter@@ ated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings forth his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period of protection , in the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump claimed that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t to Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already given sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I meant sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how specific messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an et@@ ched note , since its surveys have declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while concentr@@ ating in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze put his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ ind@@ quarters , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out to control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , cute &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sorry for just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idential Office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cozy coffee shop in William@@ sburg where you could pay cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prizes were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shut @-@ up front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people mour@@ ned as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it is also a new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained many things . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; the menu includes sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish tops such as cap@@ ers and sour onions . &quot;
there are nature travel keys .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and in the culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably posed the same .
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business occupied the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to leave her soon , leaving his new neighbours welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a dis@@ advant@@ aged building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb reaches out to get their old favorites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for ingen@@ ious delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
&quot; CO@@ E last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snacks in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture eat . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ets , this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ anu@@ t bread , liver and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ anu@@ ts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women coo@@ ks for male rock workers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country went about to be no longer the land of the land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , stra@@ ined theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se was the new bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ producing food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
peculiar mixes were tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
&quot; while resear@@ ching for the book , which includes recipes , bricks prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country ab@@ rup@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; by publishing their recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping women &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as president Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ eating @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man in the world he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining @-@ room and wore a smo@@ ker .
he was wonderfully alien to reality .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to st@@ ole an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ est . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , G@@ egel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied on food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; They really made people sick . &quot;
there was the outbreak of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were removed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pl@@ um end@@ es@@ sert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a stroke .
&quot; like a can @-@ do @-@ bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; a few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in a bom@@ bing attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who saved nearly 60,000 people according to Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant out of the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans an enligh@@ tening symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; however , as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die of saving life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four barrels over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture quoted his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest vor@@ tex is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ irs usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land shar@@ ks get young talents only with 150 years of age .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the basis of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at roughly 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long , Grön@@ land ha@@ ie was st@@ oned . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Grön@@ land ha@@ ie .
her time pup@@ il is as she sp@@ ear@@ ns six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; loo@@ t still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver that tor@@ ment from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ irs that fishermen from 2010 and 2013 were catching up against Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest was 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons search larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland ha@@ irs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens nucle@@ us , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females get offspring first , if they are more than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to associate the length of an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ irs with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme lives above all in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; the old record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon pointed , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals frequently runs on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they later mature - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal shed heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; however , a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
building plot in a double pack
the community at the latest meeting focused on issues relating to construction .
&quot; with relief , the committee accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , cancellation and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey@@ ing could be placed , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was stated , Bau@@ wil@@ kes can now announce themselves in the town hall from now on , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to meet other industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land area plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area has already been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt is benef@@ iting from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city of the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt has benefited most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is still enough for them to be approved in the UK . &quot;
this just uses big US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lobby group &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , comm@@ its responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory agency E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg , though , is home to a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure is worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .

Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge conce@@ aled a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the suit was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the pharmaceuticals of Gilead . &quot;
U.S. supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the U.S. supported the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man for the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ating after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have under@@ min@@ ed themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they freed more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council charged with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just perform clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; on Friday , H@@ illary Clinton announced her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective German tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons campaign assistant Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false prono@@ unc@@ ements and withdrawal regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as the reason for his ref@@ usal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the presidential candidate of the democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Consult@@ ant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax audi@@ ts are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his ref@@ usal to raise questions concerning fortune , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asking for his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke on the topic also during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure that people who pay more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat to exchange Tr@@ ump into a meeting to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination of IR@@ S and that Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return from 2007 to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective German tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were referred to as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective inde@@ xing fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as eleph@@ ants &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ illi pu@@ ffs .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the U.S. conservation of nature by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops , without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Ph@@ ones Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the manager of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing into one horn .

&quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests had requested an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s electoral list . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Brist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he got there , &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff stated that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and shock@@ ed by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident solved a fairly large response on the Internet , where people called up a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged demands of Arab guests .
&quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; said it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alleg@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; See &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not enter the quick @-@ election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code was added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber Com@@ es against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber foot@@ steps against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disp@@ el the students , which led the police to include rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ess spra@@ yed against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismis@@ sed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trading rate between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador shared . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
it noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an anticip@@ ates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian representatives abroad gave around 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a pre@@ dat@@ ory event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the Re@@ we XXL beverage market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the circumstances of a gun @-@ weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , from the employee of the beverage market , had the release of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly visible .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and from the gravel parking place with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the Tat@@ ars ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors during their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet recreation area Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
for one thing we went to Bret@@ ten with a visit to the pet@@ ting zoo .
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special guide for children in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group was pleas@@ antly surprised by the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to the jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers were treated with their self @-@ prepared body@@ builders such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were designed , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ vari@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ mel march of all ministers in the first two years , the Federal Minister of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided to visit the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and the Holy Bath@@ s made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage started from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again began to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the local par@@ ishes were provided . &quot;
at the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to climb around 500 metres of altitude at the same time , and then climbed again . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deser@@ ved reward was a common bar@@ beque at the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; after the morning impulse of the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in Münster in the late afternoon and crossed the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;
in the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is welcomed by Ko@@ Operator Mark O@@ bert .
after the divine service the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterised . &quot;
s@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a shock@@ ing victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after taking place in March at the World Championships in London , despite the back of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y conquered - and Sk@@ inner compet@@ ed in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , however , Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , in which execution proce@@ eded to slow down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set a Olympics ek@@ ord in the final round and conquer the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 Triumph at the Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der announced that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally fell on the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we &apos;ve been so badly away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the bicycle rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to win Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
&quot; they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the World Record , which won Gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification as officials called him to measure his height .
&quot; in the corresponding women competition , which will be continued and terminated tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Records in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a multitude of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton played in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the elimination of the energy yield
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - stand at the game , as the system operator canc@@ els the energy supply contract and thus aboli@@ shing all supply contracts , such as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , said that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are smaller . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting shop , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; that would have been in effect from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the stream@@ line supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to exp@@ el the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consum@@ es about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ress and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the popular September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to we@@ eping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , clever reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as she forgot the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic twist : you have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cli@@ ch@@ less plot of nearly every birthday sep@@ sis of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we forgot you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this publi@@ city . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a League for herself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista was on the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the revel@@ ations of his cover star will be so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize W@@ inner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to everyone else ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like any success . &quot;
with their reality TV story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ised her .
&quot; these feelings were once again high , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover . &quot;
but to go around on the mi@@ st@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ D daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; and in their spare time , they can be seen in reality TV . probably only to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children . &quot;
&quot; municipal law centers show up to 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary prime ministers are rejected annually by the municipalities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - have been rejected by their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ tax@@ ed , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ene James Far@@ rel@@ l community centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cities revealed that thousands of people have already been dismis@@ sed every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the decision of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and crus@@ hing debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by divisions , workers who have been dismis@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of hel@@ per people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the U.S. At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift those aver@@ ages , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of municipalities and their communities , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Campa@@ ign after Staff allegedly drag@@ ged a gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged action , after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm to a staff while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Bord@@ ini Regional Court , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini had waited for months to have waited for the matter to be governed internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , laid his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he gave on his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; having compl@@ ained with the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was in charge of the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to do harm , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and tru@@ ce friends - should take action , if his ri@@ val should be elected by H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judge . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made clear that the media would have torn his words from context and that he would not stum@@ ble on violence .
B@@ ord@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
try Philip to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Philli@@ p is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; phone calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before Land Elec@@ tions : SPD and CD@@ U lost
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling party . &quot;
these were representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could barely reign , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue to make the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers today dominate the world - his maker lived a disaster .
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies of high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in Western pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even via fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers , al@@ beit tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked out like a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile divisions of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and processed to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ates vendors that all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people in daily life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple just 5@@ 55 million copies . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple began its trium@@ phant success , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone off , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board of Management . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , it represented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we will create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming at the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they are wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in domestic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented le@@ dges of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; with regard to ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturer &apos;s attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; cross and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display temp@@ tations on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ post in which it hur@@ ried that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block ads in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ ying battle between the an@@ tim@@ ul@@ ing Open Source Community and the Um@@ geh@@ ers is already underway since the invention of display cur@@ ators , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying displays for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using display cur@@ sors , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of its advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company didn &apos;t have an ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on the Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &apos; Ad Pre@@ ferences Tool &apos; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ person in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a d@@ ull means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls upon witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning passed on Thursday during a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed herself in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street , and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss company , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry car . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident promp@@ ted them to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical step in such a situation , &quot; distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after killing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had responded to an emergency call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information regarding the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could have arous@@ ed similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , subli@@ me atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to shelter life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter of matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus will expose her day@@ time of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planets researchers .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably inhabited , Venus was exposed to high heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will be immediately searched for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , which Roy had hired on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick made me informed of this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has been honored as the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post@@ season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;

&quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration of the North Sea Oil Workers are suspended , while all the dispute parties for a new round of discussions are put to the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop several full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates of its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s ratings will follow a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts for the company are giving the required space to get through the market swing .
&quot; shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to launch its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its m@@ ega @-@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , which was reinforced by the British decision in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion on expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be aver@@ aged around $ 7 billion over the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in clusters of different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now turning fastest .
at peak rotating rates these gri@@ pping stars po@@ ke large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- recognize .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars more slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we like to know more about how , when and why stars are slow to slow their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the web rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ star joins
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will take the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees a last time against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to both , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ times All @-@ Star Game Candi@@ date of Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Y@@ ank@@ ees the World Series . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on December 31 , 2017 , he will work as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics show similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ all . &quot;
&quot; because as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , his appearance outside the square is cont@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star delivered to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect for years to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back in the time . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends still receive the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ ate Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a well @-@ known ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese Flo@@ at Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ steep@@ le steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the un@@ timely . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had already been proven last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ outh@@ watering agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Tribunal confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the runs over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Tribunal for CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal in Dan@@ ek@@ owa filtered through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; The only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; declared the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported to his criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; so , about all the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days before . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the runners nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the former tre@@ aches in China also ensured intense confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang in a harsh way .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 with the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
datas@@ he@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed firms in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rators to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for black@@ mail ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying quick evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the col@@ oring programmes were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ases the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without the production down@@ times . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break out business , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany many hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of sick persons . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; declares Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researcher of F @-@ Secure has examined the user areas and the contact with the black@@ heads and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat on how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ ryp@@ t for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals rede@@ em after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , declares Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus retailer Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware kits have been created by removing the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ outs are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is per infected host .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als entr@@ ust sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on the ability to aver@@ t Ran@@ som@@ ware by using file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpet@@ rators , instead , thre@@ aten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the potential for damage depends on the type of data even more than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers how they could get a thermo@@ stat integrated with the Internet .
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be quite a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators would then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling somewhat . &quot;
&quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is the storage space . &quot;
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 453 l available for high @-@ end and 10@@ 26 l in revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin @-@ up and offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , reject his work somewhat more quietly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine ization : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; the security systems are part of the city emergency braking assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane @-@ holding assistant . &quot;
the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because in the ran@@ ging many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and cho@@ oses speed if required .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI socket are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee egg at the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , they only get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms . &quot;
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of its door .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wast@@ ewater treatment that was supposed to poll@@ ute the sea@@ water .
the family was the opinion that the trip was flaw@@ ed and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the trial .
&quot; in fact , the sewage plant was defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er was only shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he did not hurt his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be restra@@ ined and decided at the same time to react to the terrorist haz@@ ards .
surely : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also raise the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the parliamentary elections in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a four @-@ digit order of magnitude more than several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon is to be revised so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult . &quot;
the most recently deb@@ ated tail light for doctors should be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères terms .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions how the threat of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of hidden investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior was clearly opposed to action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ time conce@@ al@@ ment for constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; one cannot deny all that one re@@ jects , and I lean the arm of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter dra@@ fted the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate vig@@ or and ability to act with new anti @-@ terror packages . &quot;
left @-@ party Chief Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; Fle@@ et Pro@@ verbs and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this land no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the auto@@ bahn @-@ feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic at the ambient street every evening in the traffic jam , when they travel across the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction extends over the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ turning track by 700 meters .
drivers can then directly join the Hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the transport divi@@ des itself early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the regional Repres@@ entation of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return line extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ us route and sometimes beyond . &quot;
this is why the needle clock on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided in a single lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second trail had to be disman@@ tled a good three @-@ quarters of years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to be able to record two @-@ lane traffic , especially heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated stopp@@ age will continue , the local government can &apos;t say . &quot;
&quot; however , years can be expected : because the bridge has an official remaining use period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the country has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be carried out on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
cross @-@ cultural trip : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association provides young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ gue , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are to be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
activities for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of stars : hope for weather improvement
&quot; the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we see a lot of stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star scales are Persi@@ ans , which with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , one walks around forever , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , roughly one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces occur ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can be underlying many causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ ising and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands inland , but is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an in- and through @-@ sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagner &apos;s ne@@ cht , member of the board of the German Oph@@ thalm@@ ologist Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake up is frequent in a depression , &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are going to condition each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc failure , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces become a doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week , and the day is affected should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eß . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , tired , sleeping , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any absence of sleep in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why one should first turn to the GP for sleeping problems , advis@@ es We@@ eß . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory diseases , in case of illness , sleep @-@ conver@@ ters , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one is wearing a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws which you can put on for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ eping counts on : regular sleeping and time @-@ to @-@ rise , do not sleep too long in bed , not watching television for sleeping , stopping alcohol and not watching at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and this is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first met Gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a , and at the same time he presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler can be protected against his ex @-@ team@@ mates via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
this means that we can not compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look as accurate at the topic of dop@@ ing or even run it .
&quot; I do not say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Lo@@ ung@@ es arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of the Düsseldorf Police were able to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and bag ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; against 9.@@ 30@@ pm , civilian officials from the airport of Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the mid @-@ July of this year , and were very professional and professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ als Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 are able to demonstrate four acts , specifically for carrying out crimes against Germany . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of over 15,000 Euros in total . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between the rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is not the case at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer shop . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have ten@@ ancy agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ avers , had been cleared with 300 police officers , issued official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the road and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that clearance was illegal , and a day later police and civil servants moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is here three children , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern about rising r@@ ents and g@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to have a majority of police protection from the shock@@ ing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police establish between house owners and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average of poverty and high poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street night , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga region and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them , residents of GDR times and former home@@ owners share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the rentals , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on the designed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that were dis@@ car@@ ded with color @-@ bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as bodily injury , statistics are reported almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
the most part of the off@@ ences make material damage that tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house near the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is becoming more important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drag@@ ged into the street of Riga - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the residents get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting new buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled people who are fond of coloured bombs , K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub that is badly compl@@ aining about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee investig@@ ator
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the Social Ped@@ agog@@ in supports the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups of refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a few - less spot@@ ting , rather focused on the multitude of tas@@ k@@ masters - meant that the administration wanted to write down the place . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a ze@@ al@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent job to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
responsibility changes from the council office to the Commun@@ e and the Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , so far you need to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be sanc@@ tioned as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are installed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and training aids for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ et@@ ected or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do not do char@@ itable work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive overall effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so you need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so here are administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany , and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , shouldn &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; however , problems are also available , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people at which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two are afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what some might call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have feared that the assass@@ inations would bring them completely into ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look out on the spot and in the region after activities .
&quot; in doing so , they always have the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot;
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ s are already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are about 100 people currently , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lar@@ s were looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forc@@ efully penet@@ rated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and beat the woo@@ dy to escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 meters in size , probably mas@@ k@@ ated , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ses wore . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; at the same time , police took several stri@@ pe bes@@ ions as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag went without success .
perhaps the unknow@@ ns were in fact close to the apartment or in their escape .
