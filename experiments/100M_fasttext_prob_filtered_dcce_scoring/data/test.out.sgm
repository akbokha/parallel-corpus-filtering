<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer looked for a bit diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all times - 101 tournament victories - was once again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be guided with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he was not even for photography purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport assistant presented the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Goldene sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">To awards do not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Lorrant, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already admired him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th Winner of the Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for athletic successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-fold US Champion winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gianer, the founder Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreement TTP - they want Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in favour of tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wanted to taxing the economy to death and regulate his death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw from regulators, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton on the other hand says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has privileged opportunities to open and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly forbidden by the state-critical teammy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump we could even come across party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive the coal mining in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to quit."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewable energies with its investment programme:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better then, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump in this question is to do is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage does not have to be changed, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were plowed.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has long been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they threaten politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a bearer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons outweigh the escape:" many steal secretly because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tractors require a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany, erre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single-standing women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in roughly 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich, who are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodations just for them, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich, some with no answer."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is something like in shelters of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabia alone, the fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are some common shelters or own houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be kept separate from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protective need, one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy of the Assistants have called on their union to approve new work campaigns for their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has required its entire council to approve more work activities from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "persistently quiet" "to problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re-negotiations to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as a response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board has today provided a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating working campaigns that begin at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes resulted in the fact that assistants of this year strike six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The leader of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which still took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would inevitably be introduced."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed stallied, and he hardly breathed heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was flooded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, since it was made by a presumed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veen becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most seriously, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in territories of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends he can get after having been enthralled by a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-time rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti summarized it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as it was his response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for this purpose, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pivotal to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an" "alliance of external leaders" ": two countries that refrain from the West and are badly treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey explained it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he later was the protocol chief and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as a head of state, regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time in one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidations and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff retires at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man, who was once praised as a potential president, at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - hit large scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entrust me for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the North deck of the Queensferry cross dressings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing arguments of the" "ceiling fans", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Keith Brown's Minister of Economy took a visit today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="10">"we are all the witnesses of a truly epic project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"overall, almost 79% of the total bridge-deck are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>

<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high- and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last street cover and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north side or the landing page."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate work.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action plan" "for the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratmann, president of the SPD:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable homes can also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, so Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as 20 percent of the flats as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and is still to be financed, will ensure incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of that, so Bratman, flag himself a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 affordable housing that will take place in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, as the planning-planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought-out bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on one stroke, the problem can be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt run for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West city is increased dramatically, one removes oneself from the goal of so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens anticipate that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"President Holger Herlitschke says:" for a broad majority, the CDU has to go into the boat. "</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time resting on screens, has been complained in the last decade of many."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s (later a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs) were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and once they were found," "photographed" "(via a screen shot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the cheek and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a sizable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, distributed the Washington Post recently, that within two days after launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "30 minutes" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who drives sport regularly reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also müres spoils that must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has occurred a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even when smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be saved with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman by Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>

<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness strils election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">"a culture of political correctness has led to the fact that far-spread polling fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a crushing government report today disclosed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, elective observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of elective abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who now is an anti-corruption affair, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable inks to a person's finger, if they submit their vote to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demanded that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves electoral fraud but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial asset culture that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutsk Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in a cynical way" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia inallegations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to" "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation, in which one person chooses another."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed himself alarming to the fraudulent briefing - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guide of evidence to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "the evidence was attached to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangladian background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns... state institutions have unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity related to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists manipulate briefing documents to stop" "harvest". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is taken into consideration by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list of immigrants and social betting purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic stamp.</seg>

<seg id="29">Police have the authority to set up lock-off stations.</seg>

<seg id="31">Photography offered in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Request that only English can be used in the ballot stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees usually prevail that voters alone go to the electoral cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "crash checks" of the constituencies of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud legacy as the Mother of Parliament, but the worrying and concealed spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if one approaches you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then strike it with your knees in the bar and twist while the attacker is crooked before pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist them so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and Würzeflex a serious test - by removing some of the dirtest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a Euro scarf, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a bandeau top of a tie toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before placing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of detecting the flushing button of a tie toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set up its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test coating showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to detract after its Luminometer was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products valio produced the film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says," "That's the worst thing I've got in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not lick here anything here, because it is inside disgusting."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio. "</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to them, they tick and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a delogiement with a damage of £50,000 because it had terrorised its neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treillustrated cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being rolled away from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were ringing holes, wood panels were piled up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, included street fights with baseball rackets, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikes and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorings were bitten."</seg>
<seg id="15">"neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street, and the police had to be invoked on a regular basis."</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall housing delogiated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiement were cheered by facilitated neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They strove for no one." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, tomorrow we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that it foamed the tenant to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family, as a delogiement is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is taking into account. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be considered terrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously gone to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors, and the message conveys that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogiement on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to be foaming rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeletons received a fine of money after she pleaded guilty of owning a class B drug in trade.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon was, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"having been without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they are deloozing renters who do not adhere to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police told that the Delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who do not fit and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the president of the Gülen-near Stiftung Dialog and Welt, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it might even be" "a few hundred thousand", "said the president Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard rise of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community of Germany anticipates a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"at short notice I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime further combats the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already overloaded Kurdish bursts with factions before months, 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to re-start in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the commander complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan wants to increase the reissue on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The President demanded that the German government positions itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a" witch hunt "is held against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the country election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than so far, it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and country elections - this bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the militants, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the holiday makers, who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country tag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers, the posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of voices, only to apply laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to leave election campaign close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition breakage.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it did his legendary word-karger predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blooming of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create "have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited Angela Merkel two-time chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's Bundestag group is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast-CDU largely eliminates the usual electoral conditions on market places and shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this means coking, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country it is the basis that she needs to be very strict about finding a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are on the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any of the country's expanses."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurt, namely, where people are: dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much on the game stands, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election in 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, must make the leap into the country's parliament."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and place their campaign mainly on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on trace search for native stimulants among the tourists."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">"your impression:" "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those who are responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 in the morning and only end at 8pm, there are praise everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty crunchy," "tells Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the decision will also be given to those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to setting up housing trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been reversed and therefore the connection to Rottenburg exists, the traffic situation within the place was relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now continue on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasiveness through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the deputy head leader Florian King for the transport-related management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeks were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frank in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as also the speed limits have not been observed, the congregation reinforced the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," "says King, who made himself spot on the spot himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been blurred.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest way was with 77 kilometers of kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site is gone, however, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 restauration has led to revenue streams, everyone you ask is to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership of Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "maximum slight decline", "but also states that" "the drive is missing". ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most crowded are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all restaurants have hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 per cent", "the sales revenue figures rose to" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the road" "Straßensnarrowing" "has left its operation" "two years back." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be released.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have acted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint, the hostess would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it has to bear the disadvantages inherent in the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER white from other counties, where such a generous deal has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all cases, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been located here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now see less frequently because of the complicated traffic flow, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot drive, it is also quite different."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his tribal hit returns after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history."</seg>

<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines for passenger information and truce rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some of them still works unadulterated and is open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassinations of Ansbach and Wuerzburg refugees were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people deeply occupy, let themselves not be clamped in electoral periods."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section, to skip it under the pseudonym Not AlleensamenMale mediator with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the manifold reemergence of sound plates is not based on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely runner-up group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record purchasers retain their feelings sooner (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But what are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, I'll take a humble grey suit and go wild before I steal, hold my hands and take a bit more determining how:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - still there is a handful of fantastic record specialist shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data quantity: two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (data quantity: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector? do I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and plastly."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets will apply to the youGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing union of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received impetus from the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves, from objects that evoke happy jugenderies."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff turned out from a stack of sheets."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, have not yet heard them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the poll also found out that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I floated through a stack of bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data quantity: three men of middle age) has noticed a" Trophew aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead album so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productlastig, less musiklastig."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly coming in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a lower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizers and sexbepackers Pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to figure when standing next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates that are available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a shop window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting tiles is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to be wearing the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most for luxury goods such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research suggests that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collector's and board lovers, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebee by record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old mistaken moderator, who rises above the shoulders of nothing crazy men of middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisionary transactions in which persons within the bearing goods, sell cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional dining restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid and which would present fire and sanity."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that businesses and restaurants are important since free meals, which are offered by the state-supported association and other groups, would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also advised that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people running 72 provisory businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp that is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day Rugby reached an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji has awarded a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line run and roher strength to win gold - their first Olympics of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the sharp defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of it, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a comfort for GB - but probably it won't - that at least a Brite will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost any game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into moving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau was rammed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hepstaking Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has stopped Fiji only."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua saw a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since re-anpfiff and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tackles of the GB team, stormed up to the line to make a fool."</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still stoned."</seg>
<seg id="22">NTF-C.O.N.S. Headmaster</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the Südseeinsulaner, whose fans sangen, pips and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though there were only the contributions that sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she rusted for the second Olympiagold in the second without control woman, the first women in the history of the British sport, who put on such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>

<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>

<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-growing morning to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears."</seg>

<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make some rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens which threatened the industry from green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission originally planned to ask steel manufacturers to use gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAP. there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works falle an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be collected in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, the status quo of the previous scheme was largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry has special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in view of our campaign" "Steel is Future" "is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weighed down," said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has been under overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation was further aggravated when the world's largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imported import tariffs have an impact on import steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 860,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced just six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, such as the steel trade association on Friday."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, at the teacher's degree, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">She does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior singers sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular gatherings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to listen and organize, to be able to rely on the other and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of togetherness. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense means Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the elderly exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly calls his lungs, even in everyday life is not so fast from the Puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia sufferers often abstain from long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just the elderly, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I have a long time for something, I become better and more alert beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, she advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears, when a sound comes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>

<seg id="34">"Junta boss and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat-Filters have drawn criticism in which they were charged that the app Blackface promoted or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and inflated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow vision. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat informed that it had disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on the spot in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the Military Revolutionary Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Defence Committee, reported of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically sent off by high-level CentCom units, regularly reported a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report shows detailed hurdles in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts set out."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom senvoy publicly announced that a military reconquest may start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the peak of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to bring down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force in life after they were played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an excessive process for the preparation of intelligence ratings to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest level of Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the release of intelligence reports, "damaged the morals among analysts and" gave excessive space for divergent opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no hint at the White House's intervention at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported the investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, an Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while investigations of the General Inspector were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the depreciation of the Islamic State of the Islamic State commemorated the differences of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, saw a memorandum of how the then government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, stated that contrary to the government's declarations, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="10">"as always the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work point in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pluck the helm entirely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a back handle from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and luplifted the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro's events feel constant and inescapable, a speedy match between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed by the wristband to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coffee shop, without having to listen to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womens of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names, which would have been sent to Prime Time by sponsoring and feel-TV advertising, if it would be a float, gymnast or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I could make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was perceived so sparingly that many people, I had asked, did not know that it was even an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to the competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete, who made it until the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds perfect for a clown school than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorously potential - the kartoonous trembling of its never ending collision - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and diving, the two sports which are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "jumping board". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hovering and ointages) before they land on your feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to official Olympic program, grade, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to finish, sometimes back and down, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympiakord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she jumps down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not wolves into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympics-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by fear and objectivity of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base after air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, long one ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political change in Ethiopia came to violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during the collisions with the police in case of shot change.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot dead protesters and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbulences and re-arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of worsening under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphone became more and more common and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protestant.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas flourished from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years long Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unsure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting that, according to the data of analysts, were supposedly fueled by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopia's leaders praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconduct of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month protests in Gondar, an ampersist town, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for crowning flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently announced that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin trope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dissipate the last controversy on Friday, which surrounds his campaign by attacking his repeatedly reiterated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings forth his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period of protection, in the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump claimed that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt to Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already given sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clintons's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I meant sarcastic." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how specific messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive and then" "clarify" "according to how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has received an etched note, since its surveys have declined further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while concentrating in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze put his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocant his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent intercessors, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hindquarters, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread out to control the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, cute "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps sorry for just another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Office.</seg>

<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for ingenious delicatessen on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histories.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COE last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book" 97 Orchard "tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnörkellosem snacks in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive piece, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture eat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hackets, this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which stretches the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooks for male rock workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the roads with which the country went about to be no longer the land of the land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for Americans was a central, strained theme," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"just as tense was the new budgetary: mysterious foods such as breads and casseries became staple foods, the casserole as a" wonderful way of reproducing food leftovers, "noted Ziegelman as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixes were tried because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">"while researching for the book, which includes recipes, bricks prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" it was surreal. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the recipes.</seg>

<seg id="33">"by publishing their recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "housekeeping women" "and the challenge to transform Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a feast of historic delicacies."</seg>
<seg id="35">"especially tasty are the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as president Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-cakes-eating-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke as the million-million man in the world he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining-room and wore a smoker.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor urged him to stole an example with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most driest."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vortex is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland sharks get young talents only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark swims along the basis of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at roughly 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist presumed long, Grönland haie was stoned."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Grönland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time pupil is as she spearns six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver that torment from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hairs that fishermen from 2010 and 2013 were catching up against Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons search larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens nucleus, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females get offspring first, if they are more than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature age and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland hairs with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusaleme lives above all in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the old record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year old harpoon pointed, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals frequently runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal shed heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Evarital-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided to visit the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch and the Holy Baths made their way."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after taking place in March at the World Championships in London, despite the back of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy conquered - and Skinner competed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standarround the New Zealanders conquered in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, however, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, in which execution proceeded to slow down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set a Olympics ekord in the final round and conquer the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the 2012 Triumph at the Kenny's and Hoys page, Hinder announced that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been so badly away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the bicycle rom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is possible to win Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year old from Bolton said," I enjoy this just for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived at 3: 51,942 at the destination."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, which won Gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification as officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, which will be continued and terminated tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Records in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a multitude of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton played in April in the midst of sexism and mobbingvores, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, who reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the elimination of the energy yield</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - stand at the game, as the system operator cancels the energy supply contract and thus abolishing all supply contracts, such as the supply of energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the facility of Alcoa in Portland stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effect as the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Melting, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are smaller."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting shop," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "securing transactions" "that would have been in effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," "said the streamline supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $187 million in" "anticipation of a termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to expel the contracts, the" Ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to ensure the power supply to the enamel "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Melting in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weeping," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), clever reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as she forgot the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic twist: you have all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clichless plot of nearly every birthday sepsis of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought that we forgot you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of cardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a League for herself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was on the 832 pages of the rolling stock 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelations of his cover star will be so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leakened before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, "modeled" as "models," the celebrities are on the cover. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar-Prize Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it applies to everyone else).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>

<seg id="3">The followers today dominate the world - his maker lived a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies of high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 communicator came exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros fans can buy the devices still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as an "office in Western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even via fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers, albeit tormenting slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be worked out like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile divisions of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and processed to Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market dominates vendors that all came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people in daily life."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"about 1.4 billion devices have been sold, on Samsung and Apple just 555 million copies."</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.</seg>

<seg id="6">"we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they are wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in domestic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented ledges of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is time for us to direct this Olympian spirit and expand Heathrow, as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display temptations on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blopost in which it hurried that users could update their filters in the program to re-block ads in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blopost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-frying battle between the antimuling Open Source Community and the Umgehers is already underway since the invention of display curators, "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how worrying displays for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people are using display cursors, almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>

<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its' Ad Preferences Tool 'to give people more control over them."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock would be worrying about new filters because they would block content on the site that are not advertising."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could have aroused similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, sublime atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to shelter life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter of matter."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus will expose her daytime of the sun for almost two months," "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planets researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably inhabited, Venus was exposed to high heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed firms in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators to re-use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for blackmail ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying quick evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the coloring programmes were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for unmodified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erases the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without the production downtimes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break out business, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany many hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sick persons."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims: pay not, you only promote the problem," "declares Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researcher of F-Secure has examined the user areas and the contact with the blackheads and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat on how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals redeem after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share their work, declares Security Expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus retailer Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits have been created by removing the malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackouts are looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals entrust spammers with the spread," "says Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to avert Ransomware by using file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators, instead, threaten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in doing so, the potential for damage depends on the type of data even more than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one walks around forever, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, roughly one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can be underlying many causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlafforising and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands inland, but is the insomnia, so an in- and through-sleeping disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as a result, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagner's necht, member of the board of the German Ophthalmologist Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is frequent in a depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are going to condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc failure, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week, and the day is affected should go to the doctor, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, tired, sleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleeping disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any absence of sleep in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why one should first turn to the GP for sleeping problems, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians, for example, in snoring with respiratory diseases, in case of illness, sleep-converters, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one is wearing a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws which you can put on for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weeping counts on: regular sleeping and time-to-rise, do not sleep too long in bed, not watching television for sleeping, stopping alcohol and not watching at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and this is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between the rest of the cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain is not the case at first sight, but the police is one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="4">"opposite a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy neighborhood", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have tenancy agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadavers, had been cleared with 300 police officers, issued official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, locked parts of the road and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that clearance was illegal, and a day later police and civil servants moved under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is here three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to have a majority of police protection from the shocking left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police establish between house owners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" quarter, which today in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average of poverty and high poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been vacated under a large police force in a regular street night, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga region and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former homeowners share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rentals, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the designed discs or newly painted facades that were discarded with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as bodily injury, statistics are reported almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make material damage that tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is becoming more important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately dragged into the street of Riga - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the residents get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through unsuspecting new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work, so far you need to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be sanctioned as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-euro jobs and training aids for refugees and migrants who need to be undetected or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do not do charitable work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive overall effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so you need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany, and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, shouldn't work and be useless, he will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problems are also available, says customer honestly," people at which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some might call naïve." a residual risk could and may not exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have feared that the assassinations would bring them completely into obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look out on the spot and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urs are already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are about 100 people currently, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
