Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing Israel settlement building and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal struck by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program the relationship between the two continued to deteri@@ or@@ ate .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb shared with a somewhat stub@@ born voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note written on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses headed for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already had 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police station Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emer@@ gen@@ y some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss was dying , said he has no history of violence or a criminal story . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations for problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car went still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring .
&quot; one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach her the guitar play for several years . &quot;
he was the black woman at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no deed of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter , who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 of September last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic playing before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the tot@@ e professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialised in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service . &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and and Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police said that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plan to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; toys R Us say it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer states that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it tar@@ dy to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas time of 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees , sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ ars over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated paraly@@ sis and an arm length of it , with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig is the largest time journey movie ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theatres in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the opportunities of nomin@@ ating the real estate che@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Rick P@@ erry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won &apos;t win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they would be either &quot; &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; delighted &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans believe that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their ven@@ erable guard , Republi@@ can vot@@ er hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick P@@ erry won the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters watch Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats them almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ date diff@@ users . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has harv@@ ested majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ mind @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly held their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change your mind . &quot;
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans claim that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called immigrants from Mexico two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse came to 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ si@@ veness of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey conducted by Monday , six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans agree that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans are saying in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a wheel@@ house will cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square met@@ er@@ prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top here as an exception . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ way sho@@ oter in Pira@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pira@@ eus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 51 . / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 89 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller was awarded to the Bavarian leadership of ben@@ evol@@ ent Mi@@ th@@ ilfe von Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shock of the world champion as a fl@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gle@@ aming .
&quot; Pir@@ äus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , however , with their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by le@@ eway outside Douglas Costa which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his fl@@ ank was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ l &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by taking the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians re@@ ared its usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could bet con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but the ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was lost .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given green light only after the final training , said sport director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to make something different is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the defeated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it came to Kra@@ w@@ alle stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially buried Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , not only har@@ ms the lung but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in case of ren@@ unciation the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , around 2.5 to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking is also increased risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study leaders H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tim@@ el@@ essness was affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking may increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists visit Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants of late anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum has always been consul@@ ted as an expert for archaeological excav@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the third phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century got a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman is captured by train

&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , it has borne serious injuries from the acquisition of the train . &quot;
it was treated by emergency medical care and brought into a hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .
about the reason of the ni@@ ghtly gli@@ ding of the young woman there are no findings to the medi@@ ating officials .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens dare , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by T@@ TIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to emerge with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ end con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is scheduled for the first time . &quot;
it would allow to raise obj@@ ection against jud@@ gements .
&quot; until now , the proced@@ ural parties agreed to each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the recent months discussion , it became clear that citizens un@@ familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , which companies claim compensation to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws bul@@ b , or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission to be insufficient . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised not to apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considered essential points that the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was named . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains uncle@@ ar on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells us about different places he records on the map again and again about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
&quot; where they originated , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; are smart@@ ly composed songs that seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a moving series : each of the 50 states should be considered as a result . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live satisfy him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Th@@ ise &quot; ) , a world @-@ wide celebrated masterpiece will be published in 2005 . &quot;
committed to ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sales pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth decent studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs climbed , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ cks . &quot;
currently touring Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one list@@ ens to the audience : the presentation is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; plate basically . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A
Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A since his election
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; D and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p several meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during the commem@@ oration of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several cover pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within the Labour Group , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limiting of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour made amendments to remove all the idea of limiting a whole .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26.@@ 000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who has been T@@ ory leader since he has been over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the past decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 comments . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A &apos;s Q &amp; A &apos;s Q &amp; A &apos;s Q &amp; A will be confronted with serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Eagle that the shadow of economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
&quot; he also brought the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron promised that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theater , &quot; who is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed in 1990 on television , the Q &amp; D Group was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound desc@@ ended to data , which indicate an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ron@@ eous ass@@ essments at the time of an increase in interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the Euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 229@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after acquiring the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company stocks were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his valuation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; JD Sports rose by 3.1 % , having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6,@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the chief of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor costs for his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

how Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; in the morning , however , the Pol@@ ka sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the bending construction : here her I@@ dol , whose posters are hanging in St@@ et@@ tin , lives since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as her Mama E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .

the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber self not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the blu@@ epr@@ int of the super@@ visor , he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company r@@ ins@@ ed many , many dollars to Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like he and about the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ks . &quot;
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee you will be amazed at the wind@@ shield .
for more than 100 million people he is supposed to be so exploited .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; others stress , after all , Bie@@ ber was just in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;

potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
&quot; these are both - in the potato @-@ woo@@ fers , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ iss @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay Pot@@ ato and meat were put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer sp@@ ends in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea was to leave the Leban@@ ese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich .

&quot; therefore , Al@@ h@@ ay will not reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sp@@ it contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ cash launches Ground D@@ uty Campa@@ ign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ c@@ eries Wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a soil stal@@ k campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A stores rehear@@ sals and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will carry out its annual investors strategy ag . &quot;
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in East Australia . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash gains market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal ones . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business grow by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly reply to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which provided approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operating debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler res@@ ides and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to offset sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops with fast growing fresh food and delivering a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bishment programs will be boo@@ sted by ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight due to the not@@ orious exploration of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beaten Kyr@@ gy@@ os and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a con@@ vul@@ sion sh@@ attered a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I think about myself is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke a bat as he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated with a little too severe . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all of the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick has very quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and sm@@ ashed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come out illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of immigrants met in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ ver@@ ing over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some reported from Prot@@ est food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year would have reached an agreement that the EU states would include more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a bal@@ lot action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency conference organised on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were deployed at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are eligible for protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of carrying off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence rapidly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos sur@@ rounds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and sque@@ eze a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remain outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s Vor@@ sprung before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continue to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second in second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced if he can@@ dies for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage among the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reserves , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this on their nickname Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ legi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president has a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the election are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the forefront . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den had their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased from S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the di@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these constitu@@ encies of the pre @-@ election is un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some key features among voters in the election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts off the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic constitu@@ encies of the pri@@ mar@@ ies generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being placed as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public total .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes during the tour . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Ben Car@@ son advances country @-@ wide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters &apos; support is om@@ itted in the new survey , and others lose more dramatically . &quot;
the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and out@@ breaks Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , released last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump distinc@@ tly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a real treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea during this week shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ing
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia as a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder attacks are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and had been attacked repeatedly while trying to approach a frozen section on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent , and suppos@@ edly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly was added with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died in the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment against Mor@@ der &apos;s third count for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of deport@@ ation and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates

we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession arrived within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Federal Reserve have emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however find that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low levels in order to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest charges can make things more volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be dis@@ credi@@ ted 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rates , rather flat within the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rates often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a chann@@ eler of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 points of interest since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed all year on a chann@@ eler of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ents were placed in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the loan loss accounts immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in making returns closer together between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a defl@@ ation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones stated that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity is increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened their strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and medium businesses will benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the United States , when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts become worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and likewise the financing of their debt .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their shares with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the growing dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts are different from how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP Members , Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; degra@@ dation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations , and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports was under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC Music Talent Show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of $ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; on special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he hopes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our house @-@ owned stable &quot; &quot; when it star@@ es a series of entertainment for the next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to fee payments for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down expenses in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales record to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will res@@ ign their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers strug@@ gl@@ ed around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 £ spending was issued a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are supported by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial of Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially de@@ pl@@ ores the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims who were killed when a crane crashed in Mec@@ ca .
&quot; the no@@ isy filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to d@@ ash their respect when the first of the dead played their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ star cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession was prec@@ eded by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi prince asked about the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster , which left also 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 ber@@ ths who were killed , when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ cas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group should not have let the arm of the crane stop when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad would be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ ch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mired the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the President of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased Fu@@ ehrer of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .

&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that British sett@@ lers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men , who carry out the work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry home @-@ jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ man from Eastern Europe , offered services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ men and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues after the group &apos;s reduced costs for closing shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt there are two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Viz@@ em@@ eist@@ er A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ation . &quot;
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in appeal in May . &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants were cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of association accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
&quot; this fact was ex@@ pi@@ red by the President of the Sho@@ v@@ ener Council , Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not an asset in any time . &quot;
&quot; sports officials only paid expenses and the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money from debt - the passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ winner of the financial department . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to lay down our life insurance as security with the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of financial success , the payment of expenses for expenses was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , I have paid off a part of the expenses for expenses only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump @-@ sum and non @-@ detail entries appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and spar@@ ables shared the two def@@ endants in common , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for financial security , it was important to say that it was only the freedom of education , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against which a functional investigation began due to abuse , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that were set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account went on to the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was informed that the function@@ ary was justified .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association was never caused to damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; All of you are of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never purchased a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets , he charged $ 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were unable to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept after an operational test , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also referred to as the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all Beh@@ aves should be made in cash , so that he must go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard sub@@ mits more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce which has been running for three years , the Compu@@ tern@@ ese will build further jobs during spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions of the US computer @-@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of USD 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are expected to be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the exploitation of 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP had a workforce of around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the large @-@ format group from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : thus , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both divisions should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weak demand of corporate customers after its services , placed the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the top of the market . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting and massive adjusting to change in the industry .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan shows a total of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly be rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were cons@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; a collaboration with Syrian rulers , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as and Wasser@@ werfer against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it was a police line formed and a water @-@ laun@@ cher was standing behind the police officers .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officers were initially un@@ interrupted by pep@@ per@@ oxide .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who breath@@ ed the tear gas , scre@@ amed . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered under respir@@ ation .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ al spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US st@@ aves
&quot; the world is watching when the US st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest is raised for the first time since almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of staff at Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking outlook on global proportions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death cap at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he couldn &apos;t make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot on someone and killed a man . &quot;
&quot; Lamb said the staff of the emergency call centre , that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officer killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , which is 19 , and they were &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; says Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb did call relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when police officers took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb ch@@ apped his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life c@@ low@@ n is on the site of the university . &quot;
stars that have lost their fortune
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor has also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession . &quot;
all this surely demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
&quot; at half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself alone with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ priced Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline distributed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
&quot; in the board team headed by Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new record , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective bar@@ gaining conflict with the cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union with .
the topic of talks should be the retirement rules for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; cock@@ pit wool &quot; will be able to produce results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilot , the background is the &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot;
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa is shifting routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United fails to play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
&quot; while this made the left external def@@ ender to cry and to close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , is very difficult and then is fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it lasts for six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escaped a red card and the hanging of a El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos; account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the British def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron is aware of The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ published environmental label by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , is instead a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , by reading her desire to see a real tree , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if it was not enough enough : the text presented by Cameron is in part as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a good , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he acknow@@ le@@ dges to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , a dis@@ cour@@ aged boy , like the local environment , sounds devast@@ ated by the prot@@ esting of the nam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snor@@ ing creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s electoral college .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to push Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , there &apos;s a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test Series defeat on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th dischar@@ ges from England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; leaving Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critical players are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he will hopefully get further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not yield so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I highly este@@ em .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he got 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and received four odds , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people possibly can see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England made some clever additions at the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ anth@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guy in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in tune with what was said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain out of the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances if the economy reaches a F@@ lau@@ te until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ interrupted ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to go outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long exc@@ esses such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its adoption in 2017 .
he is also a re@@ ass@@ uring force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the Br@@ a Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore perhaps some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally do not plan useful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , suppos@@ es my friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ line ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similarly about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had the principle of the non @-@ approved EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never pulled him away .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me to betra@@ y me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ alter may well say Yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet mates , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks this way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discourse among Left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded when starting on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum claimed . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims can be based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public is expected that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are serving as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acted to the statements of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; by explaining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up to East@@ En@@ ders , former Head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ented time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he spent six years in Channel 4 with no success to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that . &quot;
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who have a lot of money for the $ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform , form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC output would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be able to inform , inform and enter@@ tain on the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and go with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment , in which they have sound impulses which have high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the wor@@ ms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their motor @-@ eur@@ on@@ ors carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if ultr@@ asonic is applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily become sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence that reigned around the advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - by a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ous company advertisement , but &quot; by ring@@ ing with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the student residence in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie up : people tell you wh@@ ence you come from , where and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ as , where you &apos;re in reference to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you haven &apos;t been hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither hate nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let humans .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recei@@ pts , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and pay their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start a relationship with a university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you need to go away so that I get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
speaking of ap@@ ro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bath . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ ommate , who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb it belongs to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner to get rid of them and then see them every day , and maybe experience how they over@@ pass all common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you realize that someone has its key in its not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good trick is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t rack up your poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , single @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building contractors for people who don &apos;t have much money in Central Francon@@ ian Eck@@ ental homes .
&quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need accommodation , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed onto the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for men remain here for a great extent here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without grounds . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; legally , I have passed my project correctly . &quot;

&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we were built in luxury apartments , which hardly can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple &apos;s update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , since they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean deletion of apps to make room - but Apple has made it more likely through the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during update , or close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow Apple to continue the update because the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago , has added another member in his ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held up more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein received . &quot;
&quot; with this , it is possible to record players who cannot record the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wants that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Consulting is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; apart from consultations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation puts it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years now , with our ambul@@ ant care service , we realise that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are so many questions there .
&quot; the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is a business manager for the elderly , is also responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital and the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers of the retirement centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s are ideally complementary .
&quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; described Heike Rie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center , both managers see demographic change . &quot;
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite you to a regular soci@@ alizing dialogue . &quot;
this gives the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

men beat in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
&quot; witnesses search for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young man and put it in his face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered from the nose and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sted and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first dismis@@ sed his victim . &quot;
the last young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and passed it demonstr@@ atively several times .

there he was attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a bull@@ bar , one checked on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ hausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of rock @-@ breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich still stands on his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he is investing 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; after years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll came to know , who is currently completing her specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to pursue their own practice in As@@ endorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the gar@@ bage was bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , he has also been appointed senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ hausen works as a hous@@ eman , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as pets . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ related EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 euros will be awarded by the gar@@ bage cutter as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Hannes Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
there is still another doctor &apos;s practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the area of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor found herself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; if you visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk , by the way , check also in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf , an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen reminis@@ ces . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly sen@@ sed them after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; their man compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; so far I always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also driven to our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask a asylum request can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia den@@ ies &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia den@@ o@@ unces
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be intensi@@ fying the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not want to seal their borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly involved in Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to encourage people to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; was it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the dwell@@ ers had been around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia all night long .
&quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , in fact , the postpon@@ ement of the hitherto predicted displacement of the former Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a slightly further west distance . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister , Ost@@ oj@@ ic , had previously under@@ lined that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not say details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently been a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transi@@ tions Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic attempted to so@@ ot@@ he Wednesday early on a local emergency in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant takes up spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; be@@ j@@ ah@@ en &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; I can read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others are short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , little discussion about the action is evolving , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on site .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate to the boards publicly , it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up the people . &quot;

the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and conf@@ essi@@ onal .

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Results Mix@@ ed , Financial prospects for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit look for a year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that 50,000 seasonal workers would like to hire more than 50,000 seasonal workers . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10@@ ,90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier forecast . &quot;
analysts expected according to a pol@@ l of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and in spite of higher discounts for bo@@ d@@ ure transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless hoped that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to set 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share came to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of the analysts of the An@@ alysts Investment Research analy@@ st . &quot;

&quot; over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; market trading , about one hour before the opening , fu@@ eled the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen will spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting hall is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be cured from unprecedented incentives by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are foremost the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently survey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the equity market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage price j@@ umped by 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharp@@ ening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world reached the end of last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage price fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereby the Dow is now around 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when the interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would raise the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US st@@ aves . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Currency Authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous over the last few years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ on Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; The F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; co@@ ater , right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to interest in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its cor@@ p@@ se by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible impact on growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market collaboration in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Management of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence did not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rise because the markets are up@@ set , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hur@@ ry at the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Help for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
&quot; even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is completely different from teaching than at a real school . &quot;
Rio Grande &apos;s pedi@@ atric association promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women on shock@@ ing ways how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried authorized the building application for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ pit building at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the worked out application was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the committee , among other things , had decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; exception , &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ cor@@ ded first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the planning is to use the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again about the ti@@ lt that is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the construction plan - below 10 degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan requires no &quot; exceptions &quot; in respect to the slope - whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council generally leaves more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; however , the rever@@ ber@@ ation is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude advancement .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Administration Office for testing . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ tsch@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ tsch@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff draw from Pei@@ fen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; they see the surprising plans of the hospital group of the county , the counc@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in Pei@@ fen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further inland station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who do not want to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
the staff were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the management and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team from October 1 . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
fis@@ her is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ shank , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ fen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the supervisory board , contra@@ sted rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal union , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that I close . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years , has not been given . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ tsch@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closing in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the handic@@ ra@@ fts of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; although the Bundes@@ liga team leader is indeed the clear favourite , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the B@@ HC Bad@@ ans referred to the B@@ HC a painful defeat and have something to do there . &quot;
hunting waterfall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police hur@@ ried .
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as it could come to the accident , it was initially uncle@@ ar . &quot;

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had to kill the young people and cast their dead bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police took part on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also regarded as active on Tuesday evening , who did the fact according to the indication and led the investig@@ ator to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning , after she hadn &apos;t come home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the event of surveys in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the mis@@ eries , there was finally a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ant reported to the authorities in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the dead in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put an impact on him . &quot;
the further investigation will take place on the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Construction .
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are ready in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; in this way , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first residence accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were staying for rent last year . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany is moving into a housing deficit that is increasing from year to year .
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people therefore lived in major cities not@@ ations in WG rooms .
&quot; due to the no@@ isy on the housing market , young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Mama &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has been decl@@ ining for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , the tax tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax will be suspended for subsidi@@ zed housing . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are necessary . &quot;
the refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters are already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start of the Monday evening , 184 million euros had already been picked up more than half of the available around 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia establish cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no transit occurs , more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring country Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , do practically super@@ flu@@ ous in@@ decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; they can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police captured the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian Border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees don &apos;t encounter borders . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border stri@@ ves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clean@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive to Hungary after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 people attacked . &quot;
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws grade the overcoming and damage of the border triangle as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the sentenced thre@@ aten to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be tow@@ ed there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people had left behind the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier @-@ lat@@ tices have been disman@@ tled and one of the host camps in the border town has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the aim of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , about 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , small groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor sh@@ ou@@ ted &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday with the sur@@ geri@@ es , when ten people with travel officers stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein an end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately b@@ ang@@ ed his help and the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ hoped @-@ guests once again , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train , after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ party connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a second bridge , sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately with the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the mar@@ ginal areas .
&quot; even the p@@ oultry will have to find that the &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ fixed quar@@ ant@@ ine &quot;
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee posting .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen had already gotten a grip on .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; Meister@@ leistung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad is expecting 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ant@@ ages in the he@@ ur year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create lod@@ gings for the coming Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ars supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , where the Church will be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator also places great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of the towel rack or size of the upper eyel@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; emergency Standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary time . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is successful in placing more successful , Konrad establishes with his experience . &quot;
I am an older gent@@ leman with no further face to face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to cost , as they themselves stated . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; until now , their own neighborhood search was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings , such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees , plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because those affected are currently unable to carry out these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for an emergency , further locations should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
the mayor comm@@ its criticism of the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other areas also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the safety @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria is taking control over its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the General Ren@@ ov@@ ation of the &quot; New Shi@@ fting &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line has been officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is hired , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies in the new ship@@ yard , and later on . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 2700 square meters remaining in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to settle a dog .
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now has grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop across the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets starting at 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; prior to that , several weeks have been modified . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; Br@@ eit notes . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the city of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are in rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because of a beautiful bag of every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Palat@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; this feature also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ idential Office raises the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate date originated . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ refresh@@ ment is a term many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ town@@ rider Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young sho@@ ots , which besides Tr@@ ump is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; - in High German : the gi@@ ver , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once forbidden without permission , the director of the Institute for Palat@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
dump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that stands in stark contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the desc@@ endant .
it had repeatedly argued about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the polish , it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , men@@ tions that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; you find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ og@@ än@@ ger , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau , near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden , is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1,@@ 800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson come to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , joined London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play an important role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently renewed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &apos; Yes &apos; .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe gave an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour amounted to 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia , N@@ ine will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 . &quot;
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that it did not manage to over@@ leaf Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in great sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may acci@@ dentally have a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood un@@ locks his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and included his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be their partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game spoil , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realized ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were fairly compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reser@@ v@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose W@@ oods , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and the trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , as he lost a bar@@ gain as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula entrusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam Indi@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not introduce himself to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport was leading to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

&quot; due to the high number of refugees , the Free voters are demanding the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the state @-@ class refra@@ ction of the Free vot@@ er conven@@ es until Friday in the Commun@@ e Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did they during the Yugosla@@ v Wars during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we need to look at the causes , &quot; said the Free Selec@@ tor . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistently : &quot; &quot; we need federal standard standards in federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria does not move , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus , &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ cal intermediate level was tested for three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to finish . &quot;
but that is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums who want this .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has closed after a long @-@ term trend @-@ free and nervous process of trade with profits .
&quot; only in the afternoon was a fixed start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the medium @-@ sized M@@ DA@@ X gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the euro St@@ ox@@ x 50 , as the flag@@ ship of the euro zone , increased by 1.01 percent to 320@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked the trading posts in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index estimated at least 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock exchanges therefore reck@@ on that the markets will take place on the market until after the interest decision in the US and also for the big decline in the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
&quot; the debate about the bur@@ dens of the nuclear phase went down to a record low in the meantime , and also left deep traces on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax poin@@ ter .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the American An@@ le@@ ger@@ magaz@@ ins &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; worked off the weekend . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
investments in future w@@ afer @-@ technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market .
&quot; car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were eliminated than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA met at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the paper@@ work of the autom@@ akers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
&quot; Volkswagen advantages proved to be 1,@@ 26 percent . &quot;
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on loans of listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.50 ) per cent . &quot;
the Re@@ x Pension Index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the course of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police colli@@ ded in a crowd against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Senior District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside a police station , with some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before they come back on rubber floor .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shoes , known by which they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less mort@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ atur@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commercial and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter site in direct neighbourhood to the Art Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and housing . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for suitable offers , it is the name of the city . &quot;
which investor could get into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no agreements have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Ecke Große Straße , already purchased several months ago and demoli@@ shed the building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday houses on the little sea at Em@@ den takes shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several listeners are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure
&quot; months ago , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , grilled , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new vacation rental are located at the small seaside close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interested , medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal committee of the Em@@ press Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ end went from the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the images and new details of the desired hotel building called for intense reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , member of the marine owner and board member in the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter overlooking all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come , so that &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches double @-@ donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who has fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
reports from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a minimum of five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA veins . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has been proven effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted for people who are ab@@ normal obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is obes@@ e and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have been collecting in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those under@@ going this operation , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
meanwhile BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
&quot; among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to this , the diabetes alone solved only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflected the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by about 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ated average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ re@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.2 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study showed no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy patients in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing to individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently taking attention in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth for years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially to H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged them to stop violence in the country &apos;s home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which devot@@ es himself to Eth@@ ics Studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mired , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved those problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent response of the US took up a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low heavily alcoholic beverages , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 came to report the po@@ ison control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube how teenagers can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing m@@ outh@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain alcohol between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in inf@@ ants , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es of straw@@ berry sm@@ elling dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legal than drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah comm@@ its her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by laying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; failed &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school administration . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the old property .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars di@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss bo@@ ars to reverse things . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who is now at the top of the table with five points of lead . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period as a whole during the same period . &quot;
&quot; Schot@@ t &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.8 % was above that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Bureau ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I will be witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
anyone who is selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the jail authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma charged me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ain with her .
&quot; she states that &quot; &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking about the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was called on Tuesday to a home peace break in Pel@@ vic ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hr@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had stayed for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to look like too high hanging grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I spent a long time on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything suddenly comes out , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go around the raised head , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m doing my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I will be asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed to believe me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and they urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examinations at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ disp@@ uted master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Race Day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been like that all day yesterday .
but it was also so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested in flight to driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a colli@@ sion with a cycli@@ st and following driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycli@@ st was hospit@@ alized with helicop@@ ters to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia the police came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for lack of assistance and assistance and for other transport risks .
&quot; the cycli@@ st , a 40 year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of Tac@@ kling his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favourites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; E@@ Q@@ s &quot; with his team during the high Storm win in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved the Final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that they are concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; while tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team ple@@ aded him confi@@ dently , as it was worried that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this time again and again - I did not hear Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when she kno@@ cked us 24 : 2 , &quot; she said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . &quot;
it is funny how this happens again and again at that time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are the breaks and no points something exciting ?
&quot; for me , it is the schedules . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that in one phase we will meet them . &quot;
the Storm team was free on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit for drug ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via V@@ anu@@ atu and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of criminal matter , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the official statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he cons@@ ents to his Australian and his Serbian passport , to register with the police every day and stop at an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab rides apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was badly injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried fu@@ tile , in the last moment to turn left , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 am .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ related images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the telephone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , the terms used for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then pointed out to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to refra@@ in from having independent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; Def@@ ender @-@ Adv@@ oc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was held custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
it was added prior to the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ gel@@ er devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are accessed away from the major control points on the Franco @-@ German border .
many tu@@ gs left the fear of discovery and arrest the people on smaller boar@@ ders
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had access to the German side on foot over bridges and bri@@ g@@ ades .
there they are received by Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich main railway station , more refugees met again on Wednesday at the beginning of Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone by 8@@ am , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm ra@@ ids in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currents currently flow into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart divided . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low@@ land is the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which in the past days moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic . &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , there is still to th@@ urs@@ day early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ s from 60 to 90 km kilometres . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the autom@@ akers show their new innovations at the IAA .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals fell to this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced in between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be held by dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect of starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at EUR 16 990 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time are also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he will also come as a Com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan laun@@ cher wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 that can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n trailer was above all hand in front of the front part : the radiator grill was re@@ marked and the modified head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped .
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was especially moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has issued an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Justice Pen@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is now on the free foot after his lawyer &apos;s information , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ viewing it . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber Jud@@ gment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were author@@ itative for compensation , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the joint damage .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners . &quot;
&quot; thus , they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a decent housing had been certified to a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin j@@ ails had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to bats it should have already been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of talent , 19 shall be eliminated in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept it .
what comes up in Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the Federal Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decis@@ i@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what is coming to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 25@@ 0000 homes ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double up funding , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of State agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critici@@ zes , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; it is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migrant researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognize jobs . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour - the point of view prev@@ ailed that refugees should be made possible faster to access to the labour market . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the creation of networks is based on the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the Royal Road to the integration of labour . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only once quite important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schi@@ essen , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of the refugees - by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for teaching without knowledge of German language . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ carrying out of the Berlin School administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude . &quot;
student willing refugees could be easier access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or don@@ or do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er law more when they begin a study .
&quot; the latter generally does not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as it does not fall under the circle of the legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years now in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely classi@@ fy the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to accommodate religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to stra@@ igh@@ ten such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and why international tre@@ aties such as the Anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany commit , must be a reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all of the arri@@ vals right away from the registration of health cards . &quot;
the resulting services could be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , as many people travel with the limited power catalogue which the asylum seek@@ er law en@@ vis@@ age . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors do above all make the language barriers to be created . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated , migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would need to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would have been helped with more general medical conditions in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ covered disability , and among the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other diseases , German doctors would come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors , may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and test again tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable to the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study conducted by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ ache and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that symptoms are chronic , early treatment is necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seeking asylum seek@@ ers can submit a motion for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the welfare offices mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not educated for mental illness , decide if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites the cir@@ cus on the brick of the v@@ ases to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ boss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e @-@ production . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift of the Inspir@@ er is in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; , &quot; the director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to record loose . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
your humor@@ ous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joints . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He y@@ uan no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst is also taking a position : &quot; if it &apos;s not good to our animals we don &apos;t know well .
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be picked up by the eyes after the opportunity . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the highest command : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid &apos;s jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites to his performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims of members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , they had declared him and while talking about the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians receive SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the Parliament members concerned that the immun@@ ity in parliament will end , and as soon as they leave Parliament , parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 work@@ stations
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change . product coverage : men &apos;s Under@@ wear , Night@@ wear and Swi@@ m@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to make electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage , called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the rep@@ lication of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows a plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his involvement in the upcoming summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 League played in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have suffered most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the infrin@@ gement rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a pr@@ one time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a small break @-@ break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favourites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in store to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship celebration : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms indicated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery fell double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , vital and successful , dou@@ bles , even if in reality isolation prev@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who was shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back completely to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a phone ministry staff told me : ... &quot; &quot; My listeners &apos; role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered with self @-@ murder , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I get along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term management mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone might help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with who to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and tell you h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ade Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion since they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfection over the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which ended on the weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was st@@ ung out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ my was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , he ended up beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic played in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps , in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes stopped , with some failures and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally shortly after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth season of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent attack from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has finished a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norweg@@ ians said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ by stock sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , based in Switzerland , which is affected by raw material prices , collected some 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt value . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devast@@ ating effect on markets . &quot;
the output of subscription rights provided a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading on the early Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the 2.5 billion dollar stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices dropped by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese president Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on September 25th , and President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US president and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also be hosted by Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis Visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give way to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; explains the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , first announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before returning to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi should address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times podium finishes , four times champ@@ ions champ@@ ions , twice European champion , twice European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he stood before the European Championship before the f@@ arewell from Barcelona .
one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we do nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot;
&quot; in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown collap@@ sed when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian were arrested . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the characters of the harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is beaten by her white counter@@ part . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People campaig@@ ned for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
women &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social debate .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured deposits . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums have still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elizabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ning First Champion
&quot; professional sport clim@@ bers and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to finish the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E. about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he is doing any gru@@ dge on it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted an opportunity to climb inside a game half of Houston &apos;s Ast@@ ros for the second American league wild card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Em@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ bar , and therefore I want to go into the game entirely . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first r@@ ungs since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the punch , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ bar , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races in the back@@ stage at the end of seventh inner ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a p@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the lef@@ ty Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran out wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designer R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a Two @-@ Run in front of the right @-@ handed shooting . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run , the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit Double Play
&quot; after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Berlin made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed musician stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited for the opening of the game from an yet not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 track record with the runners in scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed on the second , a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed . &quot;
&quot; with Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury of the throwing nursery .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled from the injury list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing since August 20 due to a distor@@ tions in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches on Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ hauptstadt have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be spread to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the first recording , had arrived in Gie@@ ßen , Germany . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective departure . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military stake in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is cra@@ w@@ ling ahead of our front door , &quot; he said at Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Minister for Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees returned to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they did not call them concrete numbers and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot;
&quot; next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour deliber@@ ations with the prime ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also confess it . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye @-@ eye can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this opinion was sub@@ du@@ ly divided in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to lock the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asi@@ ons over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , however , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants to the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Iron C@@ anz@@ ee of Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ gering easily on its track around the ring planets .
&quot; this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is called in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers presented their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice @-@ ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered iron volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ inning the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a underground sea , connected the astronom@@ ers back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must for@@ ego about a month on Chief Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; an investigation took place at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , distributed by the association . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained of pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ der loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible obligation of a non @-@ discipl@@ ined pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ sten Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion about the week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should get into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a heavy colli@@ sion at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a weigh@@ ty blow . &quot;
no Diet Fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ go are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
they contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. First of all contain man@@ goes but much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruit thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleas@@ antly . &quot;
the shell color alone does not tell about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes . &quot;
it alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter flavor of some bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ates like chi@@ cor@@ ee and radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney matches well with fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service UPS puts up to 95@@ 000 delivery times for the Christmas business in the United States .
&quot; the company already started with recruitment of seasonal workers , assigned UPS on Tuesday . &quot;
most of all drivers are looking for .
last year UPS was exposed to 95@@ 000 hil@@ es for the holiday season .
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions for the Christmas business since last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had introduced the parcel services of harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ öhn@@ ungs@@ sturm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps @-@ side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n blows sometimes with a storm force through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind arches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
on the side of the Alps it breaks the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n through the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows until Thursday morning in the valleys with the Bö@@ s from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even organs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; during summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the mountain@@ ous hill@@ side . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after a large amount of rain has already occurred in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the wind dies off , as a result , a cold front collap@@ ses with strong , partially thunder@@ stro@@ yed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes high up to stor@@ m@@ ically , and the temperatures go clearly back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the city President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , an un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform@@ ator on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret their faith . &quot;
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he found the city at that time as a sin@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later fight against Rome .

hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; created are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; with this he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into contemporary contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ tural im@@ itation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old dou@@ bles a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately tri@@ ggers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant World Order . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to re@@ vise this to bring me back perhaps with the Lord father .
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to allow viewers to go into the images , to discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost joined the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot; I like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious topics for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen @-@ pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( German only )

&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration provided forgiveness , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus , hill bev@@ elled , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first common minister Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
the work should then be started with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; further pause . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga stays a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to help cope with the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic surely will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
but the crucial course must be policy .
the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiatives &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A Congress in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal governments also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ Ver@@ des put a clear sign when they are on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We &apos;ll help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes everyone , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we can take soccer players , no , we have to use our beam power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach marked the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 ro@@ y@@ alties had started their own projects was great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will each provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP executive board loses an eye for accident
&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the United States , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out on the street - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you fell down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Sp@@ are pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen beside skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a reservation driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B With@@ out Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken out in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel by L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high strain of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk to the re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of the master keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l comprehen@@ sible : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to grab the title .
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the German government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot;
the strategy paper by the Ministry of Transport empha@@ sizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and fast access to digital radio stations .
the testing of new technology is currently underway on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally , that the permitted top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far been seen as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; after a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles are expected to be expected in public roads &quot; only a long way after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German auto @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey by the Digital Network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that in flowing traffic could imagine 15 percent , at the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
oll says Team@@ - and Double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf Airport wants only to hit the title of the title from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduced the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; said the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the British football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has under@@ gone a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League Game at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , the Def@@ ender was hit by a tac@@ kling of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his attitude towards a show of his personality . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was used : to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have gone to Munich for 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always cared for strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed up his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , told Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the dis@@ appearance of fashion .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it but naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dery Machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in a large quantity for customers , which , for example , processed them to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the gran@@ aries Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry and accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also seeks to score by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer defined by the embroi@@ dery pearl in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to oppose the competition from the Asian region , high @-@ quality and innovative products must be found . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , who have to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine is embroi@@ dered in some places small spheres . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ ly Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ round@@ ings and who would like to mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
so I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping announced on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new spin @-@ off@@ s and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; says Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , the promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ ling the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally binding business environment and making the market open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how they conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the context of an offer to open up state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investors and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the Statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus consume a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ guided industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous toxic for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch called this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; sin@@ king at Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de dist@@ ra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous to humans that strongly accum@@ ulates over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; already low amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment states on its homepage with regard to the highest values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily absorbed by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations run out more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings counted for mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
