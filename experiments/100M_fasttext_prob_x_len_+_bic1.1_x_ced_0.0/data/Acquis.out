&quot; road vehicles or load recei@@ pts , which carry out a TI@@ R transport , must carry a right @-@ fitting table with the inscription &quot; TI@@ R &quot; in front and back . &quot;
these panels must be so attached that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
( 1 ) A separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be completed for each road vehicle or container .
&quot; a single car@@ net can , however , be produced for a load train or for several containers that are loaded onto a single road vehicle or a lor@@ ry . &quot;

&quot; customs authorities in the country of origin meet the necessary measures in order to convince themselves of the correctness of the product mani@@ f@@ ests and to verify the customs clearance , or to check the customs regulations laid down under their responsibility for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities can set a deadline for the journey through their country and require that the road vehicle , the load train or the container holds a prescribed route . &quot;
&quot; the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container are to be presented with the cargo loading and the corresponding Car@@ net TI@@ R of each passage duty and the identification tari@@ ffs for control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The pas@@ sage@@ ways of each contracting party generally accept the last customs agreements established by the customs authorities of the other parties , unless a confis@@ cation of goods is carried out in accordance with Article 5 paragraph 2 . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities may , however , be able to add their own customs declarations if necessary for control . &quot;
( 2 ) The customs associations recognized by a contracting party enjoy the same legal protection as national customs associations in their territory .
&quot; customs authorities may only be accompanied by exceptional cases - road vehicles , lor@@ ries or containers in their country at the expense of the carrier . &quot;
&quot; - perform inspection and inspection of the cargo of road vehicles , lor@@ ries or containers on the go . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take a look at the loading of a road vehicle , a lor@@ ry or a container at a transit route or on the road , so they have to note on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections that are used in their country , on the corresponding regular sheets and on the checks remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , and the type of checks carried out . &quot;
&quot; customs declarations in other cases are injured or damaged in articles 24 and 35 , or if goods without violation of customs expul@@ sions are destroyed or damaged , the protocol included in Anne@@ x 1 will be included for the use of the Car@@ net TI@@ R and the internal legal regulations remain un@@ affected . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) If a transport with Car@@ net TI@@ R on a sub@@ section is the territory of a state that is not the contracting party of this Convention , the TI@@ R transport is suspended during transit through this area . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the customs authorities of the contracting party , through whose territory the goods are subsequently transported , recognise the Car@@ net TI@@ R for the continuation of the TI@@ R transport , provided the customs declarations and / or the par@@ ity marks remain intact . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the area of a contracting party does not use the Car@@ net because easier procedures for the customs certificate offer or the claim of such a procedure is not required . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases , the customs offices where the TI@@ R transport is suspended or re @-@ recorded , as a passage @-@ through point at the exit and exit point at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular of Article 18 , the intended intended destination can be replaced by another identification protocol . &quot;

&quot; the passage of departure may require charging lists , photographs , plans , etc . , which are required for the confidentiality of the transported goods to the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it se@@ ws these papers with its stamp , stap@@ les a production on the back of the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R envelope and notices it in all the mani@@ f@@ ests . &quot;
the pas@@ sage@@ ways of each contracting party acknowledge the customs declarations and / or convenience signs attached by the competent authorities of the other parties .
&quot; however , they may additionally inc@@ ur tari@@ ff closures and / or convenience signs , but must be noted on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding regular sheets and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections , and / or convenience signs . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities must det@@ ach or remove customs declarations from a passage @-@ off point or on the road due to a procurement of goods or customs clearance , so they notice the newly introduced tari@@ ff closures and / or convenience signs in the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R section . &quot;

&quot; if a customs authority has been provided satisfactory proof that the goods listed in the product manifest of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been lost or lost irre@@ tri@@ ev@@ ably , or that they are missing due to their nature by natural sw@@ ans , exemp@@ tion from the evil @-@ wi@@ ese to substantial duties and duties is granted . &quot;

&quot; a ) In accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention grants information on core material , which is subject to safegu@@ arding measures , and on the features of the facilities necessary for the implementation of the safegu@@ ards in relation to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization only requires the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on plants shall be limited to the minimum required for the use of security measures relating to the core material , which is subject to the securing measures pursuant to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On the request of the community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the community &apos;s premises . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organization to become materi@@ ally superior , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further access . &quot;
a ) The organization brings the consent of the Community and States to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) If the Community discre@@ pan@@ cies either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a given denom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the repeated refusal of the Community , to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council will discuss the refusal after the General Director of the Organization - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; the General Director , &quot; shall discuss with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually perform the tasks assigned to them after their Convention .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up in such a way that the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) ensuring the protection of industrial secrets and other relevant confidential information to the inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other civil servants who perform tasks under this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ties of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention will be terminated in reference to nuclear material , if the community and the organization determine that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able for nuclear activity , which is under the point of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the community noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention will be terminated in reference to nuclear material as soon as the recipient state , as provided in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the security measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if core material , which is subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organization will agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the security measures under this Convention shall be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core embr@@ yos for the duration of the non @-@ application of the preventive measures .
B ) The Organization and the Community shall make a provision that the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are once again applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis over the total quantity and composition of this material in the concerned state or the states concerned , and about any passing on such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as soon as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a non @-@ secret knowledge of the military activity and also does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the Organization , the Community and the States bear the costs that each of them grow from this Convention on the implementation of their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however extraordinary costs are incurred as a result of a special investigation of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has been clari@@ fied in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same manner as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the Community or State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the community or the state because of damage - except for damages resulting from a nuclear incident , is governed by international law in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council fails to verify the relevant information submitted by the Director General that the Organization has not been able to verify itself by verification that no core material , which has to be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , may be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other core embr@@ yos , and may also take the other measures envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the measures in which measures have been obtained by the applied preventive measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations on questions arise from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; disputes which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not negotiated in the negotiation way or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , are to submit to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named as arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who presi@@ des over the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the states or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the association or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding upon the organisation , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this State , for the purpose of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the Community and the States consult each other upon request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately instruc@@ t all Member States of the organization of any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the contract are .
the term &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be used in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I , as required . &quot;
&quot; the objective of the measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear activities for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such dis@@ junction by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial entry and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material which is not shown for a specific time period is specified for a specified period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their tests , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material is based on a breakdown in material balance zones . &quot;
&quot; in the application of their preventive measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures shall make use of the following species and , as far as necessary , present them as far as they are intended and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of obtained , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and the quantity of stocks ; &quot;
( B ) evaluating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating uncertainty of the measurement ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for evaluating accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one and the outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) provisions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the coverage of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or semi @-@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet reached , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the core fuel cycle , is subject to the other measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for the core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not enforced , the Community is not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , for the time being , the Organization and the Community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community discre@@ t@@ ely determine that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following basic material from the security measures under this Convention : &quot;
a ) special spl@@ itting material when it is used in gram@@ mes - or small quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 that is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es out nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , from these security measures , provided the whole amount of material liberated from this Article in the states is at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ se@@ ater square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if free nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention , provisions for the re @-@ application of the security measures are met on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community , together with the organisation , meets with the organisation supple@@ mental agreements , which is necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective completion of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the Community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into effect . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization sets up a summari@@ zed inventory of the whole underlying nuclear material in the states regardless of its origin , and further carries out this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their tests . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate demand of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the Organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization sets up a special account under the term &quot; &quot; Special Trans@@ action &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is referred to by the organization as administrator , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest promis@@ sory notes of the member state , which are payable on demand in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) Payment takes place in two install@@ ments , namely , i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , considering the periods required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may make payments before the above dates upon request .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
( III ) The extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit capacity to loan terms without a discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each Trans@@ action Lo@@ an is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is considered , approved , and administr@@ ated for the financing programme of the organization , regardless of whether it is part of the organization financed by the organization ( under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the transaction account must not be used in place of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which are bound by a loan or loan for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Section 4 , a limited number of transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions which apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they can therefore be ref@@ unded in 50 years at ten free @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organisation it retains .
&quot; each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from each Trans@@ action Lo@@ an may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or services ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator specified at the time of the loan granted , may be recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; re@@ payments of re@@ posit@@ ories are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the member state concerned . &quot;
&quot; the bai@@ li@@ ff will inform the E@@ EC of the plans and programmes approved by the directors until the complete allocation of all the special re@@ posit@@ ories of the E@@ EC , which are currently being prepared for the audit by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the re@@ payment of the Trans@@ action Lo@@ an , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the Trans@@ action Lo@@ ans and the expenses that have been made for this purpose . &quot;
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the transaction account after full payment of the special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate recordings and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transaction columns , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , have not entered into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to Member States , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from will be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings .
the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat will forward these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally engaging . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to change the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation of a common enterprise named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; because until the practical use of the controlled core fusion is still extensive , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work that has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit through a merger of its research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and therefore the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction , to achieve faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be expanded or changed following the review by the organs mentioned in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new programme , this is the place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association , intended in par . 1 , is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association signed in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and individuals , herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; concluded with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of the human resources exchange concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Enterprise with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland may become the contracting party of any agreement , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs which are assigned to the association designated in article 2 , 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Association Agreement shall include , in particular , the suspension of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of the research work , and to draw the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group employed within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning current or planned programs and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s and addresses their partnership in the interests of both parties to the common goal set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are requested . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ors , which the VG research proposals are suggest@@ ing that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take up this task in respect of all research and development work that is taken into account in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Board of Directors , responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of laboratories carried out within the framework of the programme . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all the coordination committees deployed within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide the Committee of Directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the means , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take on this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country responsible for nuclear and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing the future programmes and defining its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at a community level in the area of the merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate @-@ Committee , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the VG &apos;s position on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel ex@@ chan@@ gers .
the representatives of the two parties involved work on the work of all technically @-@ consult@@ ative bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland on the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount equal to the Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product , as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this contribution is based on the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Joint Company as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Swiss company J@@ ET points out an amount that is to be determined according to the financial provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution made by Eur@@ atom on the financing of working within the framework of the Association Agreement and the Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contribution to the financing of works based on the corresponding agreements . &quot;
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover the issues fores@@ een in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year .
the Federal Council will pay the commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set in Anne@@ x III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom is exemp@@ t from duties or other duties , as well as import ban and restrictions on the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; items acquired in Switzerland or acquired there may not be sold either free of charge or free of charge in this country , unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery charges for member states . &quot;
&quot; already , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;

&quot; at the opening of the loans as well as with the possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a loan commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the exp@@ iry of one month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;

considering that Article 27 of the Convention on Chan@@ ges has not yet entered into force - I
1 . agree to cancel the determination of Article 1 paragraph 2 b ) of the Convention ;
2 . realize that the postpon@@ ement of the application for developing countries may be insufficient by five years in accordance with Article 21 paragraph 1 in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ iry of the period referred to in Article 21 ( 1 ) of the period referred to in Article 21 ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 . realize that developing countries , who are currently conducting the calculation of customs on the basis of fixed minimum values , may wish to make reservations if necessary in order to retain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions that the parties agree to maintain ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . realize that developing countries , which are of the opinion , the revers@@ al of the order of application at the application of the complain@@ ant in accordance with Article 4 could cause actual difficulties for them , may have the wish to make the following reservation in article 4 : &quot;
the Government of : ... reserves the right to pre @-@ write that the relevant provision of Article 4 applies only when the customs authorities apply to the application of Articles 5 and 6 in reverse order .

6 . realize that some developing countries have expressed concern that in the implementation of Article 1 of the Convention Problems may arise in so far as it relates to sole representatives or exclusive group imports into their countries .
&quot; the parties agree that in the case of occurrence of such problems in practice in developing countries which apply the Convention , an investigation of this question will be carried out at the request of these countries in order to find suitable solutions ; &quot;
&quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 identifies that customs administr@@ ations must be carried out in the application of the Convention , in order to convince themselves of the correctness or accuracy of statements , explanations or documents that have been handed over to the import of customs . &quot;
&quot; they also agree that the article recognis@@ es that investigations can be carried out , for example , to verify whether the submitted or presented value elements are complete and correct in connection with customs identification . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trading of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled pile - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee a perfect functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the amount actually executed is not exceeding the agreed amount and executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form become possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the Community market is not touched by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community will reserve the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement to a stool of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina modi@@ fies the amount set under number 2 corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession agreement . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be set with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of battle body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community performs precau@@ tions , so that the sale of frozen meat to frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as to slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only given at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention to interpret and apply the Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under par . 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products , originating in Argentina , is subject to an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are set in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority regul@@ ates the amounts given in regular intervals to the export lic@@ ences ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .

&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep industry and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential , and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled pile - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand maintains the assurance that the normal paragraph of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the amount actually carried out does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community insur@@ es that New Zealand is not to be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form become possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts stated in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences above these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products originating in New Zealand depends on the presentation of an export license issued by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are set in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question cannot be wai@@ ved .

the ti@@ ter is measured by always renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined in a suitable medium .
the title is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ ine di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has defined international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as entire anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents to determine the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .

&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are in such a way and in such quantities to distribute that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents returned are so long kept from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each container has a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; a &quot; incomplete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the incomplete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison of compar@@ isons to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use slides according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are specific for the C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C serum ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards c@@ c@@ d@@ ole blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ C ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 towards c@@ c@@ dd@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended to use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; sera specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised people , or can be produced by mixing of Anti @-@ D with Anti @-@ C or Anti @-@ E serum . &quot;
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies need to be effective at the same time under the conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than in the ant@@ ei@@ form antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific group A substances .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ins no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the resur@@ rec@@ ted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison table , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in every in@@ und@@ ulation within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the resur@@ rec@@ ted but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific blood type B substances .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ins no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the resur@@ rec@@ ted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison table , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells of group B to Tit@@ les ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within twice the time required if the same attempt is performed with the resur@@ rec@@ ted but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer , it does not glut@@ inate any in@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter what type of blood they belong to . &quot;

&quot; in the same vein or another on the label , it must also ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells which are sensi@@ ti@@ sed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak comple@@ ments binding in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , the load should be det@@ ectable with all types of the above @-@ mentioned in@@ complete antibodies with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum . &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant and possibly subsequent cleansing .

the effectiveness of the re@@ agent must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A Re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur in every in@@ undation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity ( ii ) Anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( vegetable ) &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant and , if necessary , cleansing afterwards . &quot;

&quot; the Parties to the European Convention on May 14 , 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; &quot; ) - &quot;
&quot; based on article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , according to which &quot; the Parties shall meet all necessary measures &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties of human origin from all input dimensions ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls into the competence of the Community , which is based on the contract by which it has been established , which has the required powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from this point on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the Member States of the Council of Europe , to all the States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this Additional Protocol to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or notification in connection with this Convention . &quot;

&quot; supported by the Joint Declaration adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community as well as from the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the boundary @-@ form@@ alities and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that the Community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the Action Programme to introduce a unified management paper in in@@ tra @-@ Community goods transport from 1 January 1988 , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administrative mandate , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that this Convention shall not be interpreted in detail , that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties of their obligations arising from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are stipul@@ ated in order to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; this is , in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Stand@@ ardis@@ ation Docum@@ ents &quot; &quot; ) , which is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties shall be fu@@ elled by means of a Single Pap@@ ers , for the im@@ prints according to the patterns in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the position paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed for sole use of the Single Pap@@ ers ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the parties involved , so that they may be eligible for a part or a certain relief at the request . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for those involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not subject to a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of incomplete registration may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application has to be filed afterwards , with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c collective agreement to be submitted within the period set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading papers instead of the Single Pap@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection paper is used , the parties concerned with the consent of the competent authorities can add to all the form@@ alities associated with the export and import duties , instead of the supplementary sheets to the general paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to include agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the form@@ alities for their entire goods traffic or for partial areas ;
&quot; - for shipments which include several types of goods , to grant the delivery of charges in the shipping method store lists instead of the supplementary sheets to a single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow registr@@ ations to be made , if necessary , by public or private data processing systems according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request data in their data processing systems for the treatment of the application , if necessary without a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to see in the case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of registration , that the export , shipping or import registration either by the import paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply cre@@ denti@@ als adopted by the Joint Committee in the Wa@@ ys of Dec@@ ision , in accordance with Article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the form@@ alities necessary for export , shipping and import@@ ation of goods by means of the Single Pap@@ ers are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
( 2 ) The common codes which are to be used in the papers mentioned in the App@@ endi@@ x I shall be found in Anne@@ x III of this Convention .
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration is to be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , authorized by the competent authorities of the country in which the for@@ warding expenses for export or dispatch are made . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) For depar@@ tures from paragraph 1 , registration is always possible in one of the official languages of the in@@ ex@@ porting country if they are carried out in this country using other than that of the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the notification of notification for each individual process section of a goods transport between the contracting parties , which , if necessary , can be included in one section necessary to grant the form@@ alities necessary for one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can however pres@@ ume that the form@@ alities for export and dispatch procedures can be gro@@ unded on one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies given for these form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities will agree as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the registration forms in the individual proceedings is consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) For ensuring a smooth goods transport between the parties of the contract and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be refused or refused , if the desired country of the view is , that the minist@@ erial aid would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; &quot; ) or other essential interests or breach an operating , commercial or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the event of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds for the requ@@ esting country are irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) En@@ tries the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which it could not afford , if it were requested , it points to this circum@@ stance in its search . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection granted to the country &apos;s domestic law , which it has received , for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; this information may only be used with the written consent of the customs authority , which has given it , and may otherwise be used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) A common committee is used , in which each contracting party is represented by the Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall establish a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub@@ committees and working groups supporting him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall have the task of managing this Convention and ensuring its proper application .
&quot; to do so , the committee must regularly inform the parties about practical experience with the application of the Convention ; it speaks out recommendations and sum@@ mar@@ ises in the cases following paragraph 3 . &quot;
( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee resol@@ ves amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee has accepted a resolution under the provis@@ o of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that there is no date , will enter into force on the first day of the second month following notification of the dis@@ continuation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets suitable measures in order to ensure effective and balanced implementation of this agreement , taking into account the need to disman@@ tle the traffic @-@ laden form@@ alities as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions in the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and , on the one hand , the agreement on the one hand as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention also applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein , as long as the Princip@@ ality is linked to the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union agreement . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention , subject to a twelve @-@ month period ; the written notice shall be directed to the Dep@@ os@@ it@@ ar , quoted in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies it to all other parties of the contract . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January 1988 , unless the contracting parties have deposited their acceptance certificates with the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities until November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it will enter into force on the first day of the second month after the final acceptance of the acceptance certificate . &quot;

&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ FRIT@@ SCH , the acquisition , comparing and evaluating statistical data , in particular those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ KT to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that goods in international trade need to be re @-@ classified , re @-@ classified and re @-@ enco@@ ded in international trade traffic , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of the trade documents and the transmission of data ; &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that the development of the technique and the structures of international trade constitutes significant changes to the Brussels Agreement on December 15 , 1950 over the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE AR@@ GE that the degree of differentiation demanded by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is far beyond that which is included in the system to the above @-@ mentioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in turn , the harmon@@ ized system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of different types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in turn , the harmon@@ ized system is intended to be included as far as possible in the systems used in trade for the designation and encoding of the goods ; &quot;
&quot; in the weighing of the harmon@@ ised system to make a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE AR@@ GE , that a close correlation between the harmon@@ ised system and the International War@@ ran@@ ty of the United Nations should be maintained , &quot;
&quot; in turn , it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff and statistical bure@@ au cl@@ ature , which is appropri@@ ated for use by the international trade involved ; &quot;
&quot; in turn , it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade ; &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s Management for the Harmon@@ ised System in this field , &quot;
&quot; in turn , that - although the above @-@ mentioned agreement on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme has proven to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals - the completion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this convention , a ) &quot; Harmon@@ ised system for designation and coding of goods , &quot; stated in the following &quot; Harmon@@ ised System , &quot; consisting of the positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ized system ; &quot;

change protocol to the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of goods ( events to Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s
&quot; it is desirable that on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the weighing of the Convention , that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the Convention at the time of the entry into force would remain uncertain . &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention closed on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 receives the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January , which follows immediately after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of at least three months , at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons designated in Article 11 or have deposited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; a . this Protocol simultaneously entered into effect with the Convention , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons designated in Article 11 of the Convention have deposited their certificate of the acceptance of the Protocol with the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists can document the certificate of the adoption of this protocol that previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time signing or submitting their certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B . any state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention following the entry into force of this protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the am@@ ended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant that is not only indispensable for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows the use of land that does not permit any other planting , and which , even in extensive farming , which is the main part of today &apos;s production , responds favor@@ ably to any improvement in the cultivation methods , &quot;
