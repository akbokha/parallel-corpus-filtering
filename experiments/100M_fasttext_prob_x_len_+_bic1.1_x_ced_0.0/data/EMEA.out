&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Dis@@ pos@@ ing thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have alternating episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high @-@ tuning ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters work to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies , up to a year . &quot;
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that led to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , who suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
&quot; in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks , and in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , nausea , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in cases of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot;
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 auto@@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appear in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related un@@ desirable events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution must be taken if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isation . &quot;
considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pl@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered to be possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , was compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ din therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term study period of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients was treated with placebo treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; with the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significantly stronger improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ing to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partially failed on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed themselves superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , which is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ isation over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in nearly 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isation by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ related effects . &quot;
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times average Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found in the study showed no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the enam@@ el tablets to use Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or breast@@ feeding during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered to be possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed themselves superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages , leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical trial . &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the enam@@ el tablets to use Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the prevention of recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related un@@ desirable events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Out of this , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status given to the medicine used for maintenance or acute care ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an advanced oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time inj@@ un@@ ction intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were considered to be possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term exposure phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ance / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) involving 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; mean improvement from bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significantly stronger improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ing to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed themselves superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C according to the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time before reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human@@ ized exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drug products in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , these indicators show that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ els in the blood , either breast@@ feeding or before the treatment begins . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to send Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out in patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for recommen@@ ding dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , particularly in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for treating the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes are advised to testify , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised before the treatment through a sperm count because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the circulation and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
listed below are the most common and major incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects reported in conjunction with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication were reported in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , back pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscle , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness very often : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen @-@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumour area due to the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single , un@@ combined trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric trial was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 Results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30 and 180 minutes of abrasion by Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular distribution and / or distance binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data were available about patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light sources over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market before the market launch provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging support . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cold boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ sen@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood sample values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ ar@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter per adult or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be monitored before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is present , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .

&quot; ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug , when inj@@ ected into a vein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before they either were either um@@ ber@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in between the beginning of the study and the assessment period from 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed on the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ ar@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ bad@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed under the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which produces ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiple my@@ el@@ oma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the onset of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring large blood volumes ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
Ab@@ ar@@ amed can be used to reduce foreign blood due to large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is necessary . &quot;
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition is necessary . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the gesti@@ cul@@ u@@ loid number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the gesti@@ cul@@ u@@ loid number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproductive cell number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgery . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the ab@@ se@@ amed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ otic or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reprodu@@ ci@@ dal value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid , or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ um@@ to@@ xi@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the label value is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason for loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered . &quot;
immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity data in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the ability of epo@@ et@@ ine if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of an@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients with chemotherapy should be taken into account for a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ coded ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated in patients with a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible prior to the start of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in cases of underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial sh@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy reduced ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses ,
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients undergoing ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the biotechn@@ ologically acquired epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis . &quot;
progression and progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies .
&quot; in the open trial , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ c events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after IV injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first given or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a dimin@@ ished state of body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ ar@@ amed for a period of up to 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the fill volume is indicated by a glued @-@ on label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .

an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients undergoing ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 149 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to the loss of the fö@@ G body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ ar@@ amed for a period of up to 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the placing on the market has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials before the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states : • Over@@ view of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to make sure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , before the drug is marketed and applied as long as the medicine is used in the traffic . &quot;
&quot; the owner of approval for the placing of the company comm@@ its itself to the studies and additional measures relating to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as described in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to update the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report and P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for human use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information that may affect the current safety specifications , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by request of E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of blood cl@@ ots in veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood c@@ lot has occurred before you , for example . &quot;
&quot; they suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ enes ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ ar@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to treatment . &quot;
very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - and long @-@ term treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
&quot; in case of hei@@ gh@@ tened or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider dis@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ ar@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ ar@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ bad@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , for example if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ ar@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ bad@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) addresses the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works correctly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice weekly , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia means that no longer sufficiently red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution in applying ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can occur - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood test after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output level is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you notice significantly or if you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; if a sy@@ ringe was taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the substance in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ ometer , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was studied .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate content in serum ( an enzyme , which separates bone substance ) in the blood , norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with elderly women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of the patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other component .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of ren@@ al complaints , reactions to the in@@ fusion station and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides explanations for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which provides clu@@ es about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the drug side effects should be explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to transport A@@ cla@@ sta across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently issued low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women - in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently issued low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently issued low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the use of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient population is available .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
&quot; before starting the therapy with A@@ cla@@ sta , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of c@@ ori@@ onic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients need@@ ing dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the use of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed up to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the disease Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron hydro@@ chl@@ oric acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was deliber@@ ated , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other mental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal cord frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over had reduced the risk of spinal cord frac@@ tures reduced by 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , the lower waist by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume with A@@ cla@@ sta patients compared to placebo .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased by BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all time points . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta therapy resulted in an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study was random@@ ised to 50@@ 8 men , and in 185 patients BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated with A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; the clinical efficacy of the treatment in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mostly mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone was examined ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 patients with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ or@@ ron@@ ate , during the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data showed a unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ A 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β for 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination cycle with a terminal elimination cycle time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the incub@@ ation period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearance of metabol@@ ised substances caused by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of c@@ ori@@ onic acid required .
there are no statements available for this population since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
&quot; for studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ lim@@ ity and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was determined in rats by inj@@ ecting doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in repeated applications was an increased primary sponge in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is packaged as a package with a bottle of packing unit or as a package pack consisting of 5 packs , each containing a bottle . &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently issued low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of appropriate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , on 29 September 2006 , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of approval for placing on the market comm@@ its itself to the studies and the additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance performed in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance Plan of the adopted 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medic@@ aments , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current predic@@ tions on the safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • In@@ side of 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by re@@ covering the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines which are known to harm the kidneys .
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with foods and drinks , you are worried that you will have enough liquid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has missed you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; before stopping the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to a low calorie concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; sore , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / bu@@ zz@@ iness , feeling disability , diar@@ rhe@@ a , temporary loss of consciousness , loss of pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , swelling , redness , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , redness , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported in particular in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you significantly adver@@ sely affect or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of c@@ ori@@ onic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , recur@@ rent hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more I &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to stop smoking compared to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the attitude of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia in this field of application was difficult to assess . &quot;
what is the risk associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during the studies ( observed with over 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in relation to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing educational packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
ag@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
depres@@ sive disorders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case prev@@ ails the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to obesity , it also has no apparent risks , and depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives are advised that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms appear .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied is assumed that the simultaneous gift of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; we have examined overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight loss and associated metabolic diseases .
&quot; it was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only mild symptoms were observed in a comparative study in which a limited number of people were given one @-@ time donations of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , versus 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference - 4,@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference - 3,@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight loss between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo was 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Wei@@ ght reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg an average waste of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours achieved , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food influence : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed a 67 % elevated C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increase in the AU@@ C in the case of the food supply . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
&quot; n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ res@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analyses ( age spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x , and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old &quot;
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ ventive data for the safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress seems to be related to the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the commen@@ cement of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3,5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study evaluating the combination of insulin and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients with acet@@ one in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to transport Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ is is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be examined . &quot;
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that may result from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
hem@@ odi@@ lution was a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ isons controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , there is a risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but promising physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for examining cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or entering the pregnancy the treatment is to be remedi@@ ed ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from available data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ege was similar to the three times the upper limit of the normal range as in the placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure among Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch rarely has been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of the Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to study the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
clinical studies over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to bas@@ eline values .
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed in most clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ en@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , and elevated HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both for tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular diseases were random@@ ised into groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the top concentration of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the three @-@ fold effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies comp@@ lied with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated ad@@ minist@@ ering plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) induced increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ initi@@ s led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tumours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for examining cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot;
clinical studies over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to bas@@ eline values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both of an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and from more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that indicated that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain functioning and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
&quot; 5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in the blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape juice , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ read hel@@ per or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration amounts up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of fast acting insulin must first be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the destination - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already seen signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gi@@ g@@ k@@ not ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take another medicine at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic to prevent g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ omas ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received 80 mg daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who received 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ uria ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; particularly in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also pose a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to sedi@@ mentary deposits ( including a known or currently present g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum acid level still amounts to 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other resin @-@ based medicines , an acute gou@@ ty attack can occur during the treatment beginning , because the reduction of serum urine acid can first mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for example in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrom ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so high in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in zine was not conducted any in@@ effective studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O escap@@ ement can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in metabolism was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ op@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without need@@ ing a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
&quot; in a study with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medium , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded with the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ otic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years , and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during long @-@ term el@@ ong@@ ation studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 Pi@@ vot@@ al studies or at a lesser frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short@@ ness of breath , skin dis@@ color@@ ations , skin lesi@@ ons , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and is created as part of the reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → Harn@@ oric Aci@@ d .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i value for in vitro inhibit@@ ors , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg / l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie . ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum urine acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum urine acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of patients with a complete disappearance of the final grades up to 24 months . &quot;
&quot; elevated TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration are easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking easier or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 - 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly produced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine passed as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; following multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the middle overall AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ ill / ml in the group with normal kidney function at 13.@@ 2 μ y Tier / ml in the group with severe kidney damage function .
12 Li@@ ver Dys@@ function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction did not significantly change the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , depression of fertility With male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed treated group , with about 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; at high doses , which were approximately 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximate the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not produce ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; the owner of approval for placing on the market ensures that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in Version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented at risk management systems for human medic@@ aments with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is necessary • when new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization , within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and this way with time a reduction of discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine • if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated due to a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in the result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out fall is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a seizure or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use any of the substances listed below , as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur , and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ c@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for th@@ inning of blood in heart disease ) &quot;
no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery were carried out .
&quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot;
on the back of the bli@@ ster pack the individual days are printed so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets need to be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .
&quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken an over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , take it as soon as possible unless the next dose is imminent . &quot;
&quot; if you break the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can rise again , and your complaints can wor@@ sen because new elem@@ ental crystals can form in your joints and kidneys and their surroundings . &quot;
frequent side effects ( more than 1 out of 100 treatments but less than 1 out of 10 treatments ) : • Re@@ pe@@ ated liver tests • diar@@ rhe@@ a • headaches • rash • nausea

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk for a low vitamin D level .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( intestinal disorders ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ab@@ domin@@ als ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , and aci@@ dic er@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE does not apply to patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
it should not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not cr@@ ush the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , can be given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al sei@@ zur@@ es , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that may indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn remedy the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , following the occurrence of symptoms , that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no elevated risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men primarily contains intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
there are no data available that indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a s@@ late surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , ab@@ duc@@ tions of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ stretch @-@ cholesterol to vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 12 % vs . &quot;
the therapeutic equi@@ valence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the desc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption In@@ duc@@ ted to an intraven@@ ous reference dose the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased according to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically meaningful changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissues after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV formulation of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance exceeds 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems in humans . &quot;

&quot; vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid in the liver and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the fa@@ ec@@ es after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

adv@@ enti@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , and the application of Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rep@@ elled after one year of treatment ( by examining , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ up@@ take of the di@@ aly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter additional studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and studied how adv@@ enti@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors need to be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with adv@@ enti@@ f , as the rate dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of adv@@ enti@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations ) .
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation in advance to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the law can take several days until the steady state reaches state . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ing of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily application in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily application in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to take place in proportion to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ enti@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initial dose for kidney and liver transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t@@ recipients , although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , were used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not ex@@ ert any influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum glob@@ ulin levels , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ ance and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution must be advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ is@@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; even after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ enti@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state entered . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the seb@@ um of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in the result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of adv@@ enti@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded term &quot; &quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to de@@ composition of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was observed as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy known as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur in advance . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical mal@@ functions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose deficiency or glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ mal@@ absorption , Adv@@ ant@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ oses , ret@@ ar@@ ated , lac@@ tose contains special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction was made with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
action of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormonal exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially mi@@ tig@@ ate the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that in Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be determined not exactly because of the disease &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; following the side effects after their incidence are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

cases of BC @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ enti@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tok@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in the treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for pro@@ gra@@ f vs c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ t patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases after a transplan@@ t transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t patients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , ob@@ liter@@ ation of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , there were 21.@@ 7 % of the cases leading to bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection came , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
a multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously treated with a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ pher as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ tations showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist , D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and neu@@ pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile . &quot;
&quot; the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ an@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients ( twice daily ) in the rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data available for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of adv@@ enti@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical mal@@ functions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital system of blood cl@@ ots due to lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
dosage and frequency of application are based on whether lawyers are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the drug is similar to another in the European Union called &quot; &quot; Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate &quot; , &quot; but is produced in a different way , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins in human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions was examined . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cells was rated &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to transport lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a proper dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of administration should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II targeted Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , where the risk is greatest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the case of pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s found in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 @-@ 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder will apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the introduction of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , brain , bone or soft tissue ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ec@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 @-@ gene , which is not broken in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; if the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs was in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to his questions , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ wom@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the appropri@@ ation has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the symptoms of hay fever which were reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients in Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , mouth @-@ dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to de@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ ton@@ ia stroke ) , or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swallow ( i.e. without sh@@ red@@ ding , breaking or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the dosage period to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , di@@ hydro@@ x@@ amine , cab@@ ar@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ ak@@ olin , etc . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data does not suff@@ ice to make appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suff@@ ice to make appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treating hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening of the headache ) must be dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise inhi@@ bit or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the incidence in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ tin expression on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 weeks treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 weeks treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly displaced . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the application of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval request , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka contributes to reli@@ eving the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart attacks , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspic@@ uous liver values were also very rare reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate for taking ( soluble pill ) , 2.5 mg / ml aga@@ ve tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( among them four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , sleeping and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials of ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current illness and can be terminated after the symptoms are removed and resum@@ ed .
&quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in several indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent side effect was headache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ tin expression on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , which was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which the chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited random@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; as the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inal diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ ching for more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of those treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients underwent a higher concentration of lor@@ at@@ ab@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( includes lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ aller@@ genic , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by an infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious r@@ rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 have limited their metabolism to the de@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience greater exposure to substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose om@@ is@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup Group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the child population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor disorders . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither boo@@ sted alcohol @-@ induced impairment nor increased sleep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the pre@@ valence of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ vers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which have been fully metabol@@ ised .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cou@@ ulation after a daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could be compared to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended dos@@ ages with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ wing bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ ate to inhal@@ e once a day in the mouth , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lic to be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were also applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in several indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; in two single dose studies A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly reduce the safety profile provided by adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el found itself as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ ate to the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical trials tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose om@@ is@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent side @-@ effects reported more often than placebo reported , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side @-@ effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ valence of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ vers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in several single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended dos@@ ages compared to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. acknowledged the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
&quot; in adults and elderly people , A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from person to person , because human beings have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this stem . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) was removed , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for prec@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of p@@ itu@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ast@@ er@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , ag@@ glut@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gen@@ ase , which was used in low doses , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults previously used in prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml under the placebo , but ag@@ glut@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only responded very little to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ Gen@@ ase strengthened the viral load with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , in A@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued to receive their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( de@@ composition of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ gra@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rein@@ for@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ate in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had not previously taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was available . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to obtain authorisation for the transport of am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years of age are indicated . &quot;
&quot; normally , am@@ ox@@ in capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore ast@@ er@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ Gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day , together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ Gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ ul@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
am@@ o@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generative medicine should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction ( 450 mg twice daily ) and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ag@@ ul@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including an@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; normally , A@@ generic capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction following anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ op@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ Gen@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 in the duration of 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ a@@ dis@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer persistent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms at the time of induction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase should not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for the elevated plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ at@@ as . &quot;
&quot; 52 % is degra@@ ded when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ an@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the in@@ comes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and ag@@ glut@@ ase are at least an hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would result .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; caution is required if this medicine should be used at the same time , since Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
caution is required when using this medicine ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as precise predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din are difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus increases the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with an ast@@ er@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with an@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions that may result in interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with as@@ cer@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to resor@@ ption mal@@ functions . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme products ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; concur@@ rent as@@ per@@ ase intake can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be expected to increase the plasma levels while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ isation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ag@@ gra@@ ase should not be applied with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with an am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generative ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as the administration of am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during the pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk among people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ Gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ cer@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ wn fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections in the case of HIV infected patients with severe immune defects ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of ag@@ glut@@ ase twice a day together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception was increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which occurred in patients who received ag@@ glut@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ prot@@ ections with the consequence of formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , these mut@@ ations were rarely observed in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the age of sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received $ 100@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ modi@@ al @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) received with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ do@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e- and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis assessed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inferior threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ v@@ oo@@ ster@@ oidal metasta@@ sis is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 of which 152 had been pre@@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies A@@ Gen@@ ase solution for intake and capsules was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
no low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ v@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ bs ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ combined am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ eg@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore an ast@@ er@@ ase solution and am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction could be limited to the elimination of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved twice a day at a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests involving bacterial reverse mutation testing , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be observed and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ag@@ glut@@ ath@@ or at the end of the treatment . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mor@@ t@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate a delayed development , were observed in a systemic plasma exposure significantly below ( rat ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ Gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would result .
caution is required when using this medicine ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as precise predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din are difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ irrit@@ asy , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generative ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in an approval of the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother , compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ modi@@ al @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ v@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ combined am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with a@@ eg@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction could be limited to the elimination of Am@@ bro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation testing , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mor@@ t@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ Gen@@ ase solution for intake was not covered in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore ast@@ er@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the medicine ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no need for dosage recommendations for the concur@@ rent application of an ast@@ er@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ Gen@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ col@@ ge@@ content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that ag@@ ul@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including an@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis should be stopped for a long time when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug - 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; concur@@ rent as@@ per@@ ase intake can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as@@ per@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk among people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , these mut@@ ations were rarely observed in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
early departure of a caus@@ ative 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Basic on these data should be taken into account in the therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ v@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ bs ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large pot@@ ting volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate a delayed development , were observed in a systemic plasma exposure significantly below ( rat ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses . &quot;

important information on certain other components of A@@ Gen@@ ase solution for intake The solution for intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l which can lead to side effects in high doses .
&quot; propylene gly@@ co@@ l may cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , special caution when taking am@@ o@@ sta@@ sis is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and performed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in over 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o @-@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream is continued until all exposed genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area , until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
in these patients it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ correction leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 ) has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
no clinical experience has yet been found to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous infections in the genital or peri@@ anal region .
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reductions in HIV positive patients , however , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term curing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in case of super @-@ mitt@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ id . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normal@@ y decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although it is not possible to quanti@@ fy serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) after a single or multi @-@ lay@@ ered topical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial are shown below .
the most common adverse event or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme in these studies was a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od infected patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; this review of clinical signs showed that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , topical skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) were observed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the assessment of the clinical signs presented according to the protocol shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe ero@@ sions ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe shor@@ tening and inter@@ locking ( 19 % ) occurred . &quot;
in clinical studies evaluating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental , unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the content of approximately 16 bags , may lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete eradic@@ ation of incl@@ ine war@@ ts during 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the genital war@@ ts were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing was achieved in 23 % of 157 treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for 6 weeks was evaluated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ nat@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that around 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od efficacy in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non@@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne lesi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications &quot; &quot; external fi@@ gs &quot; , &quot; ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ nat@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) . &quot;
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were num@@ b 0.1 , 0,2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application was low to MC @-@ affected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ nat@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg are significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected , there is a risk for man due to the systematic exposure to be regarded as very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; if untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment are important . &quot;
ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their lifetime .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used with flat ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best appropriate treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar drugs , please inform your doctor about this before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Creme only if the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o W@@ ant the cream not in@@ war@@ dly . o Do not rinse the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a band@@ age or band@@ age . o If reactions occur at the treated area , which will give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty can be expected when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream in ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x , or anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream is after sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; do not breast@@ feed your baby during the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od sur@@ passes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment varies from til@@ ting , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the ti@@ lt war@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the area around the area and 1 cm around the area .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist / pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
&quot; if your skin is too strong for the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more prone to infections ; it can cause you to get a blue stain faster , or they can cause fatigue . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly adver@@ sely affect or notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , there are lighter skin reactions that disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , con@@ formation , skin irritation , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , scar@@ ring and scar formation , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat feeling or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a , throat pain , swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to the brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not removed and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that make movements difficult , reduced lung capacity , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was examined , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect with regard to reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated had a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in over 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma may not be used in patients who may be highly sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will observe patients who receive al@@ chem@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break . &quot;
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ rites ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data of new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their length@@ ening with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children in@@ quired drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years , with mostly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up in patients aged 5 and up ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( resp@@ . premature ej@@ ection of the study ) , no antibody @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients in which there was never a serum version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 trial and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to small neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ oni@@ de activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme approach therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma were evaluated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ al @-@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the ability to perform , which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body @-@ size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant up to the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across multiple activity levels ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute ear test , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with medium @-@ run form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dose was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ ups only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ chem@@ y@@ ma dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms or if a severe allergic reaction occurred on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( malign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not been treated before , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or if certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or reduced the dose . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing . &quot;
&quot; converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural aden@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , showed longer survival times than with the comparison medi@@ an in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cervical advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as IV in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ gift and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ as@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third be@@ - treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete flow of blood should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sper@@ mat@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose testing must take place under consideration of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- , ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over the age of 65 there was an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min which should go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold the upper limit value and / or transp@@ ose values of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ op@@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent prior to the p@@ em@@ et re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced sequ@@ est@@ ration with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable in case of high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with mixed mixed methods ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential associated with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use must be avoided with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of mixed mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except when it is essential and after careful weighing of benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the sperm servicing . &quot;
it is not known whether mixed @-@ mixed mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects of the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ sis and 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be related to the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , which were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
there have been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ ph@@ ate , which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies show that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several point of attack by blocking the thy@@ mo@@ dy@@ mium syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ b@@ oni@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural aden@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy , treated patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( intent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a separate , random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5,@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adapted HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 0 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in the hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = hazard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ under@@ lie limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1,8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients also needed sel@@ - less than the administration of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine only within 24 hours after the application . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs that had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , diagnostic changes were observed ( de@@ genetics / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; unless applicable , storage times and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the contents of the 100 mg flow bottle with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % natural sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed . &quot;

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who did not receive previous chemotherapy , used to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ otheli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the rib@@ bed ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer . &quot;
&quot; if you have kidney disease or earlier one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , since you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion blood tests ; it checks if your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to obtain A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or stop the treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood parameters are too low .
&quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after the c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin administration . &quot;
&quot; if you have a liquid collection around your lungs , your doctor will decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a child during the treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as such medicines called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , including medicines that are not prescription drugs ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned da@@ in@@ ties of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take , and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine Han@@ - d@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; a hospital pharmac@@ ist , the nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( according to 4 mg dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son twice daily ) that you have to take the day before and during the day after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you have to take during the use of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA once a day . &quot;
&quot; in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) . &quot;
&quot; in this use information a side effect is described as &quot; very common , &quot; this means that it has been reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; common , &quot; this means that it has been reported of at least 1 of 100 patients but has been reported to be less than 1 of 10 patients . &quot;
&quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; occasionally , &quot; this suggests that it has been reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 of 100 patients . this means that it has been reported by at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients . &quot;
&quot; fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or about it , sweat or have other signs of infection ( because you may then have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;
&quot; if you feel tired or weak , quickly get into short@@ ness of breath or look pale ( because you may have less ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in as normal , which is very common ) . &quot;
&quot; if you notice a bleeding of g@@ ums , nose or mouth or another bleeding that does not come to a stand@@ still , or a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you may then have fewer blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) . &quot;

dissolve the contents of the 500 mg / ml bottle containing sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
&quot; it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take allergy and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , resulting in roughly a quarter of the fats covered with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed by the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss was observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ n lab@@ ours , fa@@ der strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stool , drop @-@ down secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to transport or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypo@@ cr@@ ate , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed minim@@ ally , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to take extra @-@ pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed . &quot;
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick values ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the addition of a one @-@ time dose of ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to com@@ promises regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days on normal weight and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pas@@ sive properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ aromatic li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies have derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both trials , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg @-@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg @-@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value : 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value : 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be demonstrated only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) for therapeutic doses ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic resor@@ b@@ ate dose , two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional issues : • Beg@@ in a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount equally on the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a nutri@@ tious dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Do not store drugs for children in@@ accessible . • Do not store any medication after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication on the food packaging . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
&quot; the amount of calories you have is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compl@@ ying with recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn daily 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a food diary with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ory and fat du@@ cks and give guidelines to become physically active .

the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ is was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ is ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ is is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ is for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a highly em@@ powered chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids previously given to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the large bow@@ el disease , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute isch@@ emia should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherap@@ ies studied against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not exist , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were related to Alo@@ ha , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
&quot; di@@ aly@@ sis trials have not been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for al@@ op@@ to@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) received that was given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ powered chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients given intraven@@ ously to day 1 . &quot;
&quot; results of the study of patients with moderate @-@ to @-@ chemotherapy , and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of normal pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV administration a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average duration of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ y / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
after IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that at once daily IV administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time allocation of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
in vitro studies for met@@ abo@@ lization we have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine and pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection of bol@@ us in healthy cases , the total body weight was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination rate and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications are that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the potential of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ is is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for the transport must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the medicine approved within the framework of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of the approval of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that al@@ ph@@ ema should be similar to a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ ant should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue is damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Glut@@ am@@ in- amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to stimulate the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon filed data suggest@@ ing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference drug therapy to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , it was measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is what were the biggest concerns raised by the CH@@ MP to prohi@@ bit the placing on the market ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ant , the disease was reduced again in more patients than with the reference medication ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not adequately vali@@ dated by an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected lesi@@ ons , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ early Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most frequent side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irritation on the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small lesi@@ ons , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can begin . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on s@@ me@@ ared skin or infected skin wounds ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin O@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast feeding should be continued / stopped or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect was irritation at the destination that concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; the mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should be question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; metabolism In vitro , oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro @-@ analysis of gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats indications of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 isolated skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the owner of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in Module 1 8.1 of the Marketing Au@@ thor@@ isation Application ( version 6,@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the in@@ tranet comm@@ its itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for Micro@@ products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
&quot; do not use other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it should not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is based on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a ga@@ zelle tape , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic wrap , containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zing and ensuring that the vacc@@ ination plan can be run out of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine , approved since 1996 , Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar during a six month interval between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with over 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , firm@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals , a.@@ o. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vaccine is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis A ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies observed after pri@@ ming with the vaccine are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o @-@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis B vacc@@ ination require a refres@@ her as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ prov@@ able antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 . for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody , so that additional vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be administered sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines of Ambi@@ rix were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and tolerance on a basis of calculation per vaccine Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the addition of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matches was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. throughout the entire vacc@@ ination cycle in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and tolerance was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ence Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the share of vaccine that reported serious adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ vert rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard re@@ combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 months .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given concur@@ r@@ ently with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults demonstrated similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ding to investigate any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses of vaccine , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child already has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . &quot;
• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the normally planned administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form @-@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urgent that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
falls very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 le@@ aked doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the spot or red@@ dening • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite
raises frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 le@@ aked doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C )
&quot; other side effects reported a few days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 c@@ anned doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or ves@@ icle , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix was positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine are limited due to the small number of patients . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ium is administered - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to a different treatment or placebo ( a fake medication , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium also can lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste release , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant odor of the body or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium failure in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
ammon@@ ium was approved in &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for use when there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty in swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and kidneys is carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these findings regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed increase of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it was not possible to determine whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate fibro@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old infant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand @-@ in @-@ hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately commen@@ ced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thine trans @-@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rates were 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis following single release , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dosing of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ined effects in non @-@ toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients suffering from swal@@ lowing ) or through a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nose probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ de cells of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate fibro@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fatty acids
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an or@@ al single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ule form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
&quot; during periods of durability , the patient can store the finished product only once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; when laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine can pass to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , stopping the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly adver@@ sely affect or notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and container after &quot; User Un@@ til &quot; specified exp@@ iry date .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack@@ ung AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 When laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on equal single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( hose which is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take a measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Cho@@ ose a straight edge , e.g. a ridge back over the upper edge of the knife spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; the PCI was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have undergone a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , and in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to transport angi@@ ox throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient subsequently performed a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a clamping of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous tigh@@ tening of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ certain bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second cle@@ ft dose is to be examined again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ rod @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
&quot; • known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component , or against hi@@ ru@@ dine , active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the ha@@ em@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible ather@@ os@@ clerosis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients &quot;
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of bleeding in the arter@@ ial points of the arter@@ ial jun@@ ctions occur in the case of PCI @-@ Pati@@ ents , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) can generally occur during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ rod reaches the existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when combining bi@@ vali@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din Group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to suffer from adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in table 2 &apos;s foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ par@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of the point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror by ≥ 5 g / dl with a known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ isations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tual points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial involving bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in 6000 patients who are PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ rod Group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to suffer from adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ rod than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ rod is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; binding of Bi@@ vali@@ rod to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the bonding of Bi@@ vali@@ rod @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients bi@@ vali@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory action taken by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ oid .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot effectively work insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin exp@@ ires after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other components or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections to the area of the abdominal cavity via continuous in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; due to reduced glucose tolerance and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin consumption can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ retard@@ ant , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 . insufficient dosage or canc@@ elling of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a modification of the dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change when modi@@ fying the treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , among the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or lacking . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in- and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin pulses reach the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin does not enter the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the un@@ desired drug reactions that are known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system groups and classified by decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , loss of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is om@@ itted to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin sensitivity the effect occurs faster and the duration of work is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al action in the therapeutic relevant dosage range , and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al action about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
