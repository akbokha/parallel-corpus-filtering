<seg id="1">"this document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report (EPAR), which explains how the Human Use Committee (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or its treatment, please read the package insert (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"• Disposing thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have alternating episodes (periods of anorexic high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent the neurotransmitters work to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies, up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that led to increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, who suffered from increased restlessness with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than those receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks, and in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), nausea, vomiting (drowsiness), vomiting and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in cases of bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abilify in the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, independent of meals."</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 autoinductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicidal risk associated with Aripiprazole in comparison with other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hyperconduction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia related undesirable events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsia, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution must be taken if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolisation, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisation."</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the companion therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphian / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeplzol) and 3A4 (Dextromethoran)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were considered to be possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, was compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15,1% in patients under Olandin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term study period of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients was treated with placebo treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient populations under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with the application of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and on the putt."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of respondents adhering to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depressions rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olandin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features that partially failed on lithium or valproat-monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazl showed themselves superior to the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of Aripiprazl, which is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">Mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolisation over CYP2D6 and in nearly 146 hours with 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolisation by CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients with no gender-related effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times average Steady State Exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of the hydroxy- metabolites of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the Sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazl found in the study showed no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle by monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the symptoms of hay fever which were reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"if only swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients in Aerinaze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunt), mouth-dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if required."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy."</seg>

<seg id="1696">"the effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender, age or ethnic origin."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin was detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma was administered."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers for 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in the context of a pharmacokinetical multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were badly displaced."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to the application of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>

<seg id="2026">"current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50F, M36I, I54A / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / V, I84V and L90M in combination with a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance)."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests."</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">"companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test."</seg>
<seg id="2030">"each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there are currently data on the cross-resistance between Ambroavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations."</seg>
<seg id="2032">"on the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral, non-pretreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavirus-containing scheme failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), quinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates)."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"on the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasmodial-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistence mutations in the isolates."</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a seeding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"the evidence of the effectiveness of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) received with a PI, predominantly with low-dozed ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred three- and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven sensitivity to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017."</seg>

<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of unvoosteroidal metastasis is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 of which 152 had been pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies AGenase solution for intake and capsules was tested three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients previously treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value."</seg>

<seg id="2617">"Alois is indexed: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy, due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer."</seg>
<seg id="2618">"the effectiveness of Alois for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a highly empowered chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids previously given to chemotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="2619">"since palonosetron can prolong the large bowel disease, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of subacute ischemia should be closely monitored after injection."</seg>
<seg id="2620">"however, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension."</seg>
<seg id="2621">"in addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"in preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapies studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C)."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"a clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, chlorpromazine, chlorpromazine, chinidine, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not exist, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"in clinical trials the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least were related to Aloha, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%)."</seg>

<seg id="2632">"results of the study of patients with moderate-to-chemotherapy, and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy, are summarized in the following tables."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"after the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of normal palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average duration of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the total dose range of 0.390 μ y / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was measured at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily IV administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to a value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one-time allocation of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"about 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolization we have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms per kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine and palonosetron as unmodified active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a one-time intravenous injection of bolus in healthy cases, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination rate and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 Out of preclinical studies, indications are that palonosetron can block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the potential of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pankreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice."</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Alpheleon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alphant, the disease was reduced again in more patients than with the reference medication; in addition, Alpheleon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not adequately validated by an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lesions, abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinearly Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>

<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation on the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small lesions, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>

<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2699">"the mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some infection forms should be questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and generates antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine, approved since 1996, Twinrix adults and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinet adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections."</seg>
