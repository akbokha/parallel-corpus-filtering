&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up options ... Open the Cart@@ ridge tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of default settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that more modules may be installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module feeder filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View , is to graphi@@ cally present ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps provide the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX instruction . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over to color mode , can be displayed either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is available at all , only if sufficient space for representation is present or if the area of sub@@ divided rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; how partition the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames , so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive spl@@ itting . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the image gallery module can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you access the image gallery module , a dialog opens to which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the images per line option has a slider and a turn@@ table to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the an@@ alog@@ box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nail in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , please specify whether the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails is shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder you can set with a slider or a turn field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; you can find media playback for the navigation area in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view the menu under the navigation pane , or with the F@@ 9 short@@ cut button . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for single domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses access with this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry , you can set up the range of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ phot@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ ts ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and opportunities for improvement . &quot;
&quot; wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined connection . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error correction system . all the information you need is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we want to encourage you to answer the user mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developers mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; for the first time you start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter your path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data collection is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; will also use as Al@@ bian library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , recur@@ sively searches the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless the folder is hidden . this allows you to paste a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ded list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My C@@ ases to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Properties and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ phot@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as disk drive . the camera may also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the host . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ phot@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the thumb@@ nails can be read from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , preview images may not be seen or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in &amp; edited ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either delete the page posts with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - A file type sel@@ ector allows you to select the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter appears on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog box settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ el@@ ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen@@ shot directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click the right mouse button on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to select your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection is used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Album sort by date .
&quot; buttons oldest , average , new : these put the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first edited an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ el@@ ; This is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click on the picture with the right mouse button and select the &quot; &quot; Album &quot; &quot; button in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can only be contained in a collection , and collections cannot be ne@@ sted . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keyword for single photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom in the main window . album collections always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . which information is this , you can edit settings . select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nail images have help windows that seem to appear . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such an aid window .
&quot; photos are all what it was like at &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and Edit ... Edit . in the editing pane you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of the file type . for this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed picture . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; edit ; provides two options for turning . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; er@@ ase , it is moved into the tr@@ ash@@ em@@ mer of &amp; k@@ . ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you &apos;d rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&amp; quot ; My dates list ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available the date of the last change of the file .
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view , so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ el@@ ; so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the key words are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords , by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ s@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu will appear that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and Edit Key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the right mouse button and select as the album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Key@@ words menu . the menu only shows the key words that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame to indicate the time unit . this will show all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; next he search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hits . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are displayed again . if the search hasn &apos;t found anything , then the lamp will rot . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which will always filter what you entered as a search criteria . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , push the head OK and the search is done . the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select Search , the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select As Exten@@ ded Search , the dialog for Advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the Search button . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; edited ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added line @-@ wise , separated by operators . &quot;
&quot; the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any image to find a similar . with a sw@@ ell@@ eting , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from anywhere via the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edit ; find the appropriate pictures . here too can be set a threshold value .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ Program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; press the left mouse button to pull a square . of course , all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window opens .
&quot; from the preview tool@@ bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and put it there . a small arrow indicates which copy you want to see in which window area . if you want to synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate the combination mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the image areas . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview images in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the Pre@@ view mode , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; digital Stock Management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digitally stores results in a form of digital continu@@ ance management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , protect , protect and use photos again . we focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , converts and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not need to use a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow have access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also re@@ com@@ end the metadata option in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; edit ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , &amp; edit ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you now need to assign to each photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during the next work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s take key words , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree on another . the modified keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates are characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even gives you a sp@@ ell@@ ch@@ ecker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now moving with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are innum@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by means of pictures with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files you export with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not wanted to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s working name . examples can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright paragra@@ phs , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change them in the image . for private individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the near future there will be a module for batch processing .
&quot; topics : disk failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be handled carefully and you can no longer trust you as a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . in spite of this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust etc . &quot;
&quot; it works under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks appear to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50@@ GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; read the data again with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ la@@ imer keeps your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors indicate the imminent failure . this is especially read errors and displacement counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage to your computer . thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it ful@@ fills the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers supply voltage j@@ acks , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to , and compare its safety with electricity problems with the cost avoid@@ ance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS you can think of as well your calcul@@ ator is protected with it . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide , at least , the data integrity between operating system and hard drive . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate internal sequences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of faults per year . &quot;
&quot; sun Micro@@ systems Z@@ FS seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS is using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer seen . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that as the technology develops further there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t be responsible for any other data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing disks or res@@ izing hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then some@@ day , a flash hits you happiness if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another benefit of physical separation : as already said above , there is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generate multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system , except that it is only sam@@ pled and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed .
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , store memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression of the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and put the area you want to increase to a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; parti@@ tioned resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of drive if needed &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace the GI@@ F . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open gross image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . D@@ NG is already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , to replace its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider using D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on an architecture and modeling , discussion and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot;
&quot; export the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into Web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edit ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras , it may take a while . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side strips properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer details , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as for the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from All . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all of the photos , you can only choose the one you want with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ . . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New to download is available . these images have not been edited until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album appears in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edit ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you must first select them and then delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were downloaded successfully into a &amp; edited ; album , before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera qui@@ ver completely , you should do this about the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you upload photos of different recordings into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will copy the information about the author in the Section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information are copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters when you download them . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo is in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be edited ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; edit ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to switch on this option . use the Advanced and select the date @-@ based panel at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , you will be asked where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image to a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents may use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first you should know that there are at least three GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters ha@@ iry coordinates created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; edit ; tries to give you so much control over your operations as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to edit settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or start image processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s title : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be names like e.g. employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
IP@@ TC actions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this is achieved that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; edit database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the embedded cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; edited ; album folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the lighting table settings can be set to the default values on this page . each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing this View Mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
&quot; with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF @-@ File option , you can turn on the &quot; &quot; Def@@ late &quot; &quot; compression algorithm for TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with setting loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly becomes a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the red pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which is photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default is the tail@@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to catch the top @-@ lights in the settings . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ re@@ stru@@ tion option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should advance conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process , to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and that a matrix of colored pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ ather . &quot;
&quot; after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , since it is performed during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from a color space to translate into the other are therefore the colors as accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in the image processing / start color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correc@@ tions . currently , D@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are more options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your picture would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon &apos;s profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ ts , image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window &apos;s menu and additionally you will find some in the context menu of the previ@@ ews . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the top knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that is displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Auto detection which attempts a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture display mode . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on . &quot;
&quot; check if &amp; edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash b@@ ins , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photos and delete an album , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; used if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without question , otherwise you need to apply changes using the button changes . &quot;
you can also edit &amp; edit the display of the welcome screen ; this will speed up &amp; edit the boot process .
&quot; looking for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete them from the database . &quot;
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . preview the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; edit ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the entry ad / edit .
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing are changing your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using it from the File Rec@@ over menu or using the button Once the image processing is restored in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save . &quot;
&quot; nearly every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action can be und@@ one , by modi@@ fying undo / restore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and note C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in tool@@ bar or entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : &quot;
&quot; view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can edit the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can view this from the &amp; edited ; main window . see the section to set up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print@@ out dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; you can print single images or whole sentences from the main menu . you only need to print entire images from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Print Ass@@ ist . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; edit ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation file , also in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same rider makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the cap@@ tion view , you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you have commented on it , either use the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be used either with a single click of the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; edited session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords with a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word Filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side bar is used to change the selection of pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search view . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is displayed on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Vari@@ ed .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it would be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner can have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual captured or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that are from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to get you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; their only other image output is by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and so you have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB &apos;s limitation compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cancel my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ ate your monitor , because s@@ RGB pursu@@ es the circle . when you work as a s@@ RGB colour space , you either need to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection attempt automatically to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ bing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed @-@ out images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . &quot;
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow alignment allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it in a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences panel will rever@@ t all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for several photos simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always requires the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quot ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by inver@@ ting a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image . the result was a partial negative of the image . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar stabili@@ zation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for a color film , optimized for daylight produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; when you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ force / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the slider for the application described here . concrete the three shi@@ fters below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the control box to see how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment . &quot;
exit application : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input value . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the spec@@ s of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels in order to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most useful one . in this case , linear mode yields a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a c@@ rank@@ case to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the processor @-@ mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left panel of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain general brightness even if you are using the appropriate color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mono @-@ current , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save and then load any mixer settings for later , then load them . the file format used is the gi@@ mb@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels in order to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the Blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford &apos;s FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Panasonic FC Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky .
&quot; orange filters : simulate a black / white film direction with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate moon scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white felt coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of making a pressure and re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ an pad . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; using the &amp; edit ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied on the photograph below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief was set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; edit ; tool frame add , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . the picture is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add an ornamental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image that is decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this can also be done in several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; edit ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a template over an image . &quot;
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image processing can be used to stack templates across a picture .
&quot; you don &apos;t have to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the templates , just send an email in English to the &amp; edited ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next startup . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates is set , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting an folder automatically updates the preview tool@@ bar of the templates . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button shr@@ inks the image underneath . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . just take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it &apos;s very fast and easy , but it creates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture blur@@ red . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust . &quot;
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to a slight blur@@ ring . SL@@ R cameras normally need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , however , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call this with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but you should be careful , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is much easier than shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tested . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the sum represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the focus . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the picture . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in the image processing .
&quot; the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is influenced by the distant pixels . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your shar@@ per is wrong . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading and comp@@ ressing images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally Un@@ ke@@ yed Mas@@ k@@ ieren makes better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Wiener Filter , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result can be traced back to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob strai@@ gh@@ tens the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink t@@ ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ sp@@ ection algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value fl@@ atten@@ s even in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a movie memory or CCD sounds a high value will generate wa@@ vy @-@ like patterns . JPEG &apos;s art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to om@@ it it . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . &quot;
the &amp; edit ; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , you may need to adjust the edges -@@ filter if you change this setting . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more distorted , but also gre@@ ases the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) .The noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than shar@@ pen a picture . use tool to mark sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s h@@ iss , movie pun@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the texture mapping is done with another tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG &apos;s arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie memory on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the scanner and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; edit ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows Hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality rough mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel @-@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; bright pixel &quot; &quot; ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard detects the last dark image and invites this automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; edit ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , in particular the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it has disadvantages too . many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which allows the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise vag@@ ue effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ ance damp@@ ing at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , reducing it by a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; edit ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting gra@@ ding applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; edit ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but flat@@ ters at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold . &quot;
&quot; the Co@@ efficient 4th degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the distortion of the fourth degree . this value acts more strongly on the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Corner parameters has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby correc@@ ts the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks .
&quot; light : this value adju@@ sts brightness to the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the Ton@@ nen@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . ideally , you perform this correction as first . if you cut a picture and then perform a tone @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ Cut cutting tool from the image processing or via the Zoom button of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ed correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for movie ton@@ ing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the option Add movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of movie gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter bl@@ ends color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top @-@ lights .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; edit ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; edit ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es monitors the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
&quot; the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful , if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with . &quot;
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top knob adju@@ sts the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; edit ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Block 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Be@@ enden button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixel around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary @-@ moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then re@@ produces it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button .
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . it gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
&quot; you can keep with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing an area free of rain@@ drops . to do this , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ cking filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirrors or rotating . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for that purpose . each st@@ utter@@ ing for photo may be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; blowing your photo is very fast at what it does , but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ enden button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photograph will be cut away . this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can drag a new rect@@ angle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the blank , use the cli@@ pping button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly edited photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation in portrait format or landscape format . in high format , the higher value of the height and the cross format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; trimm@@ ing the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the combination help make it possible to blend aids , so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ hand rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles with the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden divide is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third angel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is centered on the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to these lines can cause a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the Color button , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you hold the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . &quot;
&quot; the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences panel , you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function trans@@ former cutting from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is to cut the function Automati@@ cally . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . note , however , the warning above . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal loop e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; she@@ ar your image by using the Horiz@@ on@@ tal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ oring tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single loop this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ading generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to file a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; edit ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is based on the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , then the file will be edited ; you can edit this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of rough formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . and digi@@ ti@@ zed , but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display films or edit . &quot;

&quot; if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the range right of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper area shows the original , and the lower one shows the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to view the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ Program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; press the left mouse button to pull a square . of course , all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ ts ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the &quot; &quot; pallet &quot; &quot; view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box at the cur@@ sor is activated under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected . you can adjust this mode by selecting the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , trimm@@ ing and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if therefore three numer@@ ical values are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; insert . &quot;
the colors in the palette and color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
&quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then find it in the color selection on the left side . &quot;
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that include graph@@ vi@@ z are based on the program author &apos;s view &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs .

load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which is the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of the graph@@ s . in particular : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewers ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &apos; dot &apos; files , the main window looks like the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance , or want to show the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both later and later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a number of graph@@ s distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Rest@@ art page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
opening the page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewers ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up more possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described in the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell . the command should display the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and display the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of the graph ( directed or executed ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ghted graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
display the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source repository &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ not ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z tools for display . it requires the following packages :
&quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find further options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar , the status bar , the color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; create a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog appears in which you can choose if the icon is to be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch . &quot;
&quot; reset the last und@@ one step . if you have not made a step undo , this function is disabled . &quot;
inserts the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gre@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not correspond with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
inserts the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; adding ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can modify the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixel or show a ruler and set the colors : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner display . you can also adjust the size : the kar@@ os for small , medium and big as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Images can be used to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the san@@ e project or another source like video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default reduced duc@@ ts to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after pressing the Scan button , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the image window appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; specify or create the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots can be generated after you have selected the Import &gt; screen@@ shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been taken , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
this module will archive your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for comfortable navigation . also the Auto@@ Play option is available for the Windows platforms .
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional features . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and more capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management system on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to people who are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world that photos of your camera phone online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus quasi your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to enable you to log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module ex@@ its to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , you need any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
&quot; the key word field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words , which are added to the image as tags during the upload . &quot;
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location correlation . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to get a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here .
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation indicates an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no track data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference options in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and enlarge it . always select this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module image gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on an image , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated ima@@ gery . for this , select a folder on which you have a write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the preview images will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to close the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increased , as no compression of the colour information takes place . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera mount is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can add a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the images which are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module . &quot;
&quot; the images you have selected are then included in the image files in the portfolio , where you can also edit the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to return the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under name of the MPEG export file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start with the button coding the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow once you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right down . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats , JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer .
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image afterwards . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images often or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided : &quot;
&quot; propor@@ tionally ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have pre @-@ selected . add more images via the button images . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to send you the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the Pictures button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your email client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are attached as attachments .
do not send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used again each time until you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ Mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG among images file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slide show , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL output option in the presentation will enable very elegant picture transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ame shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
&quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . afterwards , you can manually break it with Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; selecting images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so the order of the images is not used in the album . &quot;
&quot; between the images , the time interval between the pictures can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your calcul@@ ator and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect at each transition between the images .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can pause and start the presentation again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have completed your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can start with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , now in each group , so in people , locations and in the group keywords entries are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . they can save with &amp; photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save his own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that is on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you must determine which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the image for the respective person . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the Search button in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you wish , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not shown Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try new features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry , photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview display ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will click in the preview view only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create from the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into three areas : content , Layout , and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the thumb@@ nail and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . so , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 must not download images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all of your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if they really all are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . so the import function , see , function properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are just described are related to all three on base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output file . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to share your images with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work will not be done again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; w photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images . the advantage to save all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ in file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files will be brow@@ sed . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export images will be described , which you can access via the Export File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; with the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copying &amp; photo@@ album with option Automati@@ cally copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not recommended to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and what categories will match them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual are talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and used this for future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; w photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Res@@ et Photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the different settings are explained .
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups , e.g. objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; click on the dialog box that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in one group instead of all groups of a member as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window you can select the category you wish to configure . in the left half of the window , there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; therefore , you should test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : in doing so , an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for albums for some modules so you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simulation &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so whether you selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are not compatible with &amp; photo@@ album , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you see the window that you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the picture has been taken . for example , you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , because the names used are moved upwards , find the persons more quickly and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add comments . in this case , just click on the front and back buttons below , which are under the preview of the picture on the upper right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the US as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from within a frame , by dra@@ gging it outside of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... to save you the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the image shown in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use Photo@@ Album , namely pictures without you stored on your hard drive . of course you must have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the disk . for example , images 1 @-@ 9 can be seen . for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; photo@@ album ; however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature requires you to get files from the folders and copy them back in . &amp; photo@@ album ; please don &apos;t support it until now , to avoid inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid irritation like the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those remain that you may want to make for others and click on the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you are now giving your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry Images , eliminating all the images you have locked . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to view it sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where has it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; S buttons . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer &apos;s viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom in . in order to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom back in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the results of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the button key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that enter and zoom out with the plus and sub @-@ key .
&quot; with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment , you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you will probably prefer to mark only the image and see more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to draw pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by placing the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have attributes to your images , they are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever have been selected , simply add them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be allowed to paint photo@@ album ; on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in yellow wire mod@@ ells .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu appears to enable you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error report . then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or reject the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
&quot; the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot;
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected , or their Visi@@ bility Level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object &apos;s properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning on the desktop or click the small pointing arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer strip . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with View window array ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the View Sc@@ ene View menu . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to l@@ essen the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is split up and adap@@ tively because the depth depth depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to generate noise for the beam process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpectedly finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the Property View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . insert the path to your document and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. height fields ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate .
&quot; you can set the object scope of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail loyalty to extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to the projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section it is explained how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views using the button removal .
&quot; with the new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating down the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have exactly &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start without a detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you have to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select Edit but@@ ton@@ .@@ So you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you generate . in particular you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , you see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the Application or En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert infinite body rect@@ angle ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; in fact , offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as the ground : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Apply or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ item . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment still . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see a color on the box and sphere in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each one color and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should be able to do this step by step , since you should have understood the basic mode of operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be easily done as easily as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the ground as you shifted the ground to one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select the first sub@@ item and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on the pigment , then select one color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the screen@@ shots below and click on Apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection settings are already in part good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal is not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler offer . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered is needed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeatedly the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Rec@@ ently .
&quot; stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or add new ones .
open a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
&quot; a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each fle@@ ece on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , using an image file as a color chart . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
using &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust below . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you are still watching the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;

&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ ts ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . all the information you need is filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of a show@@ room , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to join a show@@ shot ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . &quot;
&quot; there are many options that change the behavior of a show@@ shot ; there are many options that change the behavior of a show@@ shot ; to access these settings , you need to change the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicator area you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to indicate . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure , a dark color . &quot;
the main window of the &amp; show@@ room has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page header in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&quot; &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images , which no longer works than scanning and saving images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer do than scan and save images . for each image , you can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of the sc@@ anners . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options especially .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only launch a preview can and then scan for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview display in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the ep@@ onymous dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels ; images can be selected . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; input ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can do so with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE &gt; dialog for &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; sn@@ l@@ ite ; to exit .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of this short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts you can set up by right @-@ clicking on the player window and set short@@ cuts . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script might now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information can be asked about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
&quot; customize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example to do clearing operations , for example storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 , only script packages will be accepted with the replacement amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just look for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard to decide , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists to automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled for them to be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; want to help , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition to the play@@ lists , the player window will turn on or off . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will display ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ able / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save the playlist to the end of the playlist , save the current playlist automatically by adding &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist in the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be stored . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window opens / rolls in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the appearance of the Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting proprietary fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Custom color scheme , you have the qu@@ al of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do this , use the colour selection activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing while starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program starts the play automatically continues with the play at the place with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ ts ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders , and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should display the O@@ SD . &quot;
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; scan sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the selected and their sub@@ folders to music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists later appear in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further equipment is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that is entered under Port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
&quot; the flash@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and , if required , create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
invo@@ ke similar performers : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers will retrieve the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages , so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , pres@@ ume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / collection _ Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading Met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of them are compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will result in crashes while editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens during a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) look actively in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest with the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers , use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ che@@ en@@ o@@ .net in Channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , just a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in ? &quot;
&quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left , and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras Terms . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or , right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably miss the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be : which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder is provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ ful reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously record audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the amount of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . &quot;
read the Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the log @-@ register again . &quot;
please report on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets you start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened from the soft tones of the music that you have stopped prior to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; read the current title if you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ . &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do this , press the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in size . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the paste button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the control panel &apos;s system section ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can edit the valuation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the item , or press F@@ 2 . you can edit the review in the metadata dialog . &quot;
developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a defined release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install this under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area enables you to control and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu ;
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler will be completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to re @-@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed in addition to G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error of There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as System Administrator register . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... audio output will give you the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ r@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on the sound card m@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of anymore . of course you can take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so much @-@ needed advisor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; create a playlist is very easy . drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist and save it . you will find this button in the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . to do this , add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please choose Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the button Play . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
&quot; the burn function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry , and follow the burning menu . you have different ways to burn a CD . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM , apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time for the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the scroll display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also under the scroll display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position @-@ slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ ts ; available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub @-@ windows will later be explained in detail . they provide information on the current piece on different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may have noticed that the Start has dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras stat@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; the music below shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . underneath , you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to hit the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; you can find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display covers images which have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next field , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the received pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpreter .
&quot; you can adjust which information should be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . with the right mouse button , click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the album &apos;s content . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in each section to begin playback immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button , and then select from the context menu one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t have a text script yet , you can choose which one you want to start . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Collection Database , and no running text script is required . &quot;
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ es only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list of Vari@@ ous performers . &quot;
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( most recent first ) . when the year is unknown for an album the default 0 - album name is related .

group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and including by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but additionally sorted by album under the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; there are several time windows available , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . you can also select your complete collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options . &quot;
download - This records the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Get the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on one entry gives you the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue for transmission to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section . &quot;
all pieces of this interpreter will burn / Bur@@ n to CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed this option will not be shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( s ) Post@@ p@@ one files into the garbage b@@ ins ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; set up a compilation marker - Change an album marked as set back to a normal album . afterwards , the album is no longer displayed under different performers but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists are easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists can be added . click &quot; &quot; Add Smart Play@@ list &quot; &quot; to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by performer in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can retrieve music from a given URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping files . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert the dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries using the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button for a long time until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces del@@ im@@ ited search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , containing one or two or three ( or a combination of them ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ a little search for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side you can find the Add , with which you can add the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the pick @-@ up rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you will see in the player window over the right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and de@@ activate the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plugin . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry a sub@@ menu hides with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting promotions covers management in the collection browser .
the Cover @-@ Administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , a number will appear in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played at first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select store . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix will immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . you will need to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection . you will need to add at least one piece by yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
the New fill the current playlist and add new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will skip and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under consideration of the settings . &quot;
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you select more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on setting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts will be installed by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script for a longer time , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the Dialog window visu@@ alisation plugin is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or any other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the read @-@ out of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data is to be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback from the forums and get news from the forums . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you require at least 1 k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , it reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned @-@ in audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a sophisticated MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will be reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save as it displays where you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ames for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file save .
&quot; if a project has changed and hasn &apos;t been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what to do with it , just as if you have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it is asked what to do with it , as if you were calling file C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Bur@@ n , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? help described ( achiev@@ able via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you to see the files and folders that already exist on the medium .
&quot; this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only blocks the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you want to burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record all the ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the tran@@ scription and incre@@ ment@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the Content View , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the Content View and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks and dis@@ closures of the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view includes open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty , and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to modify the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the signature selection below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to run CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators are required , so you have to enter the password for system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ not ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which of the included programs you prefer . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void Bl@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string values ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string values ) void call@@ back ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ select for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , quite simply audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many enco@@ ders that code these wa@@ v files ( This enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more codes can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Co@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up needs to be performed only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , it will be explained later on the daily use to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , with everything manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , for example , you can find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the Code tab in the Direc@@ tion Code - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it should be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the code tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to code rather than a full &amp; CD ; read out and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here , you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you select the correct enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recordings is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) add if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : this means that the author is meant ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address than the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only be known by the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for it ; if you want to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information can be obtained about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . in this case &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write rights on it ( eg ; trying to copy something in with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
here we define the enco@@ der to use the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at every reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work , or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the Cart@@ ridge General Settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / ke@@ yed as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be notified when information is missing for the creation of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the Cart@@ ridge CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b @-@ server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , as the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box . &quot;
just take over the settings of the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; simultaneous reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check out the &amp; CD ; throw out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if only space is created on another disk . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something needs to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; as previously mentioned , this is an attitude for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly selected the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successful fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; insert data manually , rather than fetch it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , seek help in the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best fits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic inquiry of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the comment field of the album can be used individually for each commentary , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after a successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help with the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button All items select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking the knob Sel@@ ection of the selection process started , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; assignment # 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions contain already pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ k package . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , the following is the right one for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step sample to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading it ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program starts ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to fetch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , which other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and / k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for G@@ US maps . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag into &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid can pull .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
&quot; session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this works also with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the Ab@@ ility from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use texture and others use lyrics and others . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not need to manually set up automatic text selection . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can compose . these will be played in line . in this section , you will find how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then adding the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the each shot in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add . it appears again the file dialogue , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not checked , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened items . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , record next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Pre@@ vious piece , record Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have just one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
de@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; The name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... &quot;
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds like a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each note represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards own ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is its presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map notes to the perc@@ ussions channel . watch the provided key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , it will always be used patch x@@ . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; pitch @-@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio is calculated in which pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events multip@@ lied . thus , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM demonstrates that there is a keyboard that will play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see which sounds are being played on these key@@ boards .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list , where you can select an instrument . if you have modified one instrument , the button lights no more green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to view the played tones . view the view in the Settings menu under the Point Channel View : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; OK , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have open on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( when I play a MIDI file ) , only switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , adjust the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to write to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am studying Mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my free time and I don &apos;t want to get money from anyone . I would like to stress that I &apos;m only getting more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , I would like to thank all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ not ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . when you click an entry , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player file can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost if you leave the Edit mode , or select another group without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g dur &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; In the list tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; S@@ ME ; &quot;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ d / share / k@@ mp@@ lay @-@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &quot; flash &quot; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player needs to be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the direction dialog file In@@ dic@@ ations of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that a given back end is always taken for a certain Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ d / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be brow@@ sed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , from which one is selected . the to be used encoding must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contained a dv@@ d in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must also be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally by KM@@ Player , various names are used for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this source is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ den source . &quot;
&quot; are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , when I play from it ( not the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom commands can be run as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU needs to be tested for its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; ly@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; website should be established . &quot;
questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are requested should this be addressed at the list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; box ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one easy , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ operate assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; make ; and to learn about his possibilities the manual for Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , also a lay@@ man ( english lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while only a good overview is given to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to master properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; same as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick entry assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . some of the settings related to the document may also be made .
&quot; document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , Buch , &#91; edition &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Paper ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
encoding : the character encoding is set . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements used ( example ) : if you see larger areas of a large text on the screen , it &apos;s likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; automatic completion of the settings is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; box ; automatically generates a blank line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line to the string of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings box , ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ... file independent file ) was created &#93; , start &amp; box ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is besides PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified . tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up in project settings . &quot;
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( unless there is any error in the source code ) .
&quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be upgraded to &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ s.@@ com. &quot; &quot; and it is not a call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick build . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The distributed &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection panel is for the entry of articles such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e &quot; &quot; is used for defining the font size . it can be set the font files for the main text , the foot notes , etc . there are following type@@ faces available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font file is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the push of a button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; box ; for the storage automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if it is used by fast @-@ build , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few acid sets are supposed to have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of the fon@@ ts within the environment . &quot;
the changes are merely transferred within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to obtain the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ pa@@ yout : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background is displayed for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box is now followed . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to do this , at least one quote , a few passages in the fat and cur@@ sive form and a poem can be used to see the differences in these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the Editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex source code has been created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . you just need to set up Modern under Settings box ... tools can be balanced .
&quot; to complete the pre @-@ select search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewer is then made . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; box ; opened and to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; box ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( set the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if there is no error when using quick @-@ build up the &amp; DVI , an error may be present . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file tells the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can be used for fla@@ ws of La@@ Te@@ X errors and multiple La@@ Te@@ X errors . to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , you have to click on the error in logging and &amp; box ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or used to create a new document to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; top users from &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... settings General can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as following : \ \ $ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched on the Internet and the steps described below should be searched . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ ems ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for plac@@ ards ; can be made directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
&quot; to learn more about them , and to experience its possibilities , the manual for Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le can start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is merely \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional boun@@ ce marks . this is a special type of book@@ mark inside the text . the volume edit jumps , or the respective key individual may result in the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also highlights this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Po@@ ems ; already excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; box ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code are supported ; special commands for their selection are supported . &quot;
&quot; he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source . &quot;
&quot; he@@ als the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command is also called &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back reb@@ ate ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Al@@ tes ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; box ; offers with its commands here for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a more convenient work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to buffer the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group , there are a few important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings . &quot;
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly brackets of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , it is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted braces group clips , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used for purposes . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation is used in &amp; box ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple suits . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two close suits for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double feeder mark can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when pressing Shift , En@@ ter key for &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; box ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables , environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; search &amp; box ; after the next tab in the next line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Po@@ ems ; already offers a good source code exhaus@@ tion , this in &amp; box has been added ; three different modes are installed . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings box ... Complete . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the entry will be removed and as a result the exhaus@@ tion list gets lost . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are easily removed by selecting a command . alternatively , can be filed by &amp; ki@@ le , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with editing pane N@@ est jumping mark and the desired parameters can then be incorporated . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there can be different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as wi@@ pers of the general language use can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the complete destruction of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin will have to be entered and the call to complete destruction mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; box ; a special mode for complete destruction of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling Complete settings over the menu Edit Compl@@ et@@ ely environment or key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically opened for setting the surrounding area and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the surrounding plot can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; box ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be installed . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of exhaus@@ tion mode for &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of sections that are immediately replaced by a longer string . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word completion mode initiated over the menu Edit Complete shr@@ ink@@ age or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ chner is not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many users in one document are written more than once . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le Complete . here , the threshold value for displaying the plot can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the installation files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue with graphics creates the impression of graphics as simple as possible . to overview the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to examine the results of the work , you have to compile the source code . all building tools are compiled in groups in the menus , Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ating View . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used for Alt @-@ 2 key . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 via Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project will be asked about the project &quot; &quot; New Project .... &quot; &quot; with the following information for the project : &quot;
&quot; when closing the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ led@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le ; others .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction guide for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; contains the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k containing a database with all the available documents and for a graphical surface area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space key opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; box ; is also part of the Fink project , which supports &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

&quot; &amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , an arbitrary signature is extracted from the signature file by &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures , the same signature is used for the whole day from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this will save you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your signature in the lower section . &quot;
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use emails private or professionally there are always enough signatures .
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot;
&quot; in order to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the pile application is , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call stack entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . all of these tools use com@@ mon@@ y as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the war@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I already said , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the open file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be reviewed using another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be edited in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the file and select the file to be processed using the other file . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ ths , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the t@@ apped in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit Pan@@ e menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the speci@@ fying team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information sent to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that takes a file to CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see where such conductors are set up .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following :
you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or insert the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
&quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a part of the project resulting from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the appropriate range or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces are invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with one after another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed with it . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close optional tags : if requested , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for the detection of different types of files .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; create backup copies periodi@@ cally so that in case of a power failure or crash , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting the documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own View ( or the documentation in a Cart@@ ridge ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ root command line parameters .
the warning message area serves to control the display of warnings by hooks of un@@ solic@@ ited requests .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be set automatically . empty verti@@ ces are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause is abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins can be managed by third parties , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; charge component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , select it if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set up , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plu@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is produced , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the view Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if it happens before a de@@ bug begins , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a request is made , the execution begins as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where , if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one , as if there were not the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s consist of two types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic lists of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , which could fit text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the property dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow for quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without risk of a typ@@ ist .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders include the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing but nothing else than anything else .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
gives the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a one element type .
gives a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but look at &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this feature is currently not available . currently the review is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; the following is an example of a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP is described ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it available via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Version 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set actions with Settings ... to be created . click New Action to create the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by pressing the user defined button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; using the button , the current key short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script tries to find : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , you can use a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input , you can specify what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard error output . it can be specified what to do with the output written to the standard output , by setting the value of the output : &quot;
&quot; when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use , activate Di@@ alogue &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; Menu ; , Graphi@@ c More Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; use 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this icon will be inserted ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , as there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be split into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog over settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; secure in the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their function bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done it for you already . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you have to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we leave the first part to you , the second we treat you here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag = tag@@ 3@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # in Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but bew@@ are &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the section of contents is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to design the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bars tool@@ bars , and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signing . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ et .
&quot; the conversion can start from the menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialogue appears : &quot;
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ war@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to draw the full benefit from and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related items are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are em@@ o@@ iled in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ cle@@ ment the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; click the right button of the mouse to get a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all flash@@ cards , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area to a further context menu concerning the edited document content , how basic editing steps ( crop / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , Help the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . &quot;
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
&quot; using tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the representation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all options are open to you . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available ; local templates are always available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only available in the project .
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens up in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window can be accessed over the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all the changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can backup and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other tool ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while attempting to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ ts ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for that . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ ath ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to leverage an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . with self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has quickly become a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more details about the documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ inic sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on Tem@@ plates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ write , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window , or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
training and switching off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
display the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; ab and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; this creates a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions need to be added by means of settings . tool bars are stored by tool@@ bars of tool bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removing a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; loading / refresh entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar in the Tags menu . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar refuses , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed below the menu items listed above . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on posters ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switch between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes take time or cause unnecessary graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; makes ; one can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can add and change sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , as the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information panels can later be set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is starting from scratch , it is not possible to hook up files that are located somewhere in the project &apos;s root folder . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to your own discretion . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the check@@ box , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or using Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders available ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the Sub@@ window Pro@@ files upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , by showing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration event you can turn on event promotions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see details . &quot;
by default open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project choose Open Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders will behave just as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent upload files are needed , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk cache option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own mode of operation . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best stack@@ able using the tool@@ bar menu . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols on this can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be removed , the tool@@ bar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be set , where it can be specified , what actions should be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with tool@@ bars ... and set Settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates provided have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents with links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . &quot;
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted in the documents again and again . you can include everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As a local template . &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree among project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate store select as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily pulled with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files to create a name for the template and secure a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically add them to &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; template structure in sub @-@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when el@@ tery attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path , unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( showing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed from the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second partition the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is active , the button will move the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , with the position being maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template , by pressing the button and selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of cur@@ sor is like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using button or remo@@ ver button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , has to be removed any other surrounding anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant , are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; they will have to use the tables or lists tool@@ bars in this release . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successful , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned post@@ ures can be set in a specific file and line number and enabled later . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire match is verified with a suite named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is expanded according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
&quot; a built @-@ in holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template with x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are checked again shortly after the start of each flow . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging . &quot;
&quot; the program I used only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other in one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously show the result to be expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check codes , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can simplify the typing by using only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the matching or merging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , copy them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info row of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info row has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small help window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the color indicates the corresponding color . when differences in white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line dividing the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is scored on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the reference windows ) also has an info row with the wording Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . typically , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merging or by manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps a different source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you might copy and insert elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page up , page , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; in the default window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image Ab@@ tern ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . there is also the option Sel@@ ection to copy automatically . if this is enabled , then whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is eliminated . &quot;
&quot; line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when activating this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences panel automatically adju@@ sts an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board then does not need to be copied . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line feed \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return character , however , may be disabled as a white character . &quot;
&quot; this option is disabled in default . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . comments in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow for very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for comparison and merge tracking .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you have to quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the coding fields for coding a short note appears , which is local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply ignore the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you view the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut off annoying parts or correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ 1 / &apos; The . * is an erg@@ ular expression of the found text in one line . the \ \ 1 converts the found text in upper@@ case .
&quot; the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they &apos;re very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processing command for new@@ line compar@@ isons . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ All@@ hol@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs you only needs ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start
... &quot; simul@@ ates the merge and displays the simulated changes , without actually performing it , &quot;
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded down . you can flip up a folder by double clicking on the + / - or double @-@ click on the object . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders .
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the name in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the joining action cannot be automatically selected . if the merging is started , you will be informed again about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . with folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified , and if the option to synchron@@ ize di@@ rs is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical after that . if for one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge select ( uns@@ af@@ e ) then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors can not be started , the merging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when merging is executed one file after another . the Status column shows finished when the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is al@@ right all over . &quot;
&quot; if the file compare method is selected full @-@ time analysis in the setup dialog , it will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all combined actions ( including in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , it will be used in the three @-@ folder merge mode C as the target , with the two @-@ folder merge B as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries in the destination folder should be displayed , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if invalid merge actions still exist by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective items . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options to perform , simulate and cancel . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen , without really making any changes . you will then receive a full list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select another directory entry / resume , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you solve the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge operation ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can try to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 settings menu ; set up menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set to folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceded spot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is enabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the alter@@ ation date , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are the same size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed either . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only merging whole folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view stays visible while merging single files ; you can disable the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch off main windows in the window menu and switch between the list &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; this status , however , is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE supports this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always assumed as Link Target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to process per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ YO@@ VE@@ LO@@ P from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if it is applied as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 removes the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is now available ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but K@@ DE will not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the fourth to each other , this is the case more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor re@@ members any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this has been too great so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text , suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; published and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information on how you can use the diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot;
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on one system , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 base folder ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you shouldn &apos;t have problems when comp@@ iling . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) paste the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you must re @-@ read the refresh folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also causes identical files to be copied not to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual working areas . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu only depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager ... and ends . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and end . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual working areas are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working spaces . if it is shown together with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shown . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty working spaces will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual working areas in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation at the side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and select switch off switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; K@@ mag to use a part of the screen as if you read a lou@@ pe for the clip or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; kis@@ ses ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start &amp; kis@@ ses , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , shows the enlarged portion of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , you can zoom into the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard k@@ b ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the enlar@@ ging window . this also works with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ b , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected pane is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and shrink &amp; etc . &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and that each mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that every mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clearer : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief devices , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the mouse button has pressed . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move , before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Move mode is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button will wait before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; is this function enabled , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ bo@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ not ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and click here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best use is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later undo the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce &amp; k@@ de response times ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which parts a mouse @-@ click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe off the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you use the intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action with which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while clicking the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . this means that every time you click on a mouse click , you will know exactly when the shifting time starts . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , which causes pain to be pressed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag process to start , before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sc@@ run@@ away memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have to install k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken word is attached to the default memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; settings dialog ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side word supplement and the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding , which is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you can find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection panel action , after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the list for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant , the selected text passage is spoken directly and inserted in addition into the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down slot of the editing window for text pas@@ sage@@ diary , you can determine if the text pas@@ sp@@ ell@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose edi@@ ts , the text@@ book script will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word supplement page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ector , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the source code ; the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , and over time create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can change only its name . &quot;
&quot; add new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected ranges of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected ranges of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected sets of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is arranged by default over the editing window directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably didn &apos;t complete the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ ts ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice command page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ ath ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , allow text to be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can spend time and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer is included . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and adjust the speech @-@ speech tool . &quot;
&quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers installed , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card General appears . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the Cart@@ ridge Navig@@ ator Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card box is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all the speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . please click on the flash@@ card orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language output system ; click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succ@@ eeds , the flash@@ card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and use the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it will continue , as long as the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control panel when reading , it disappears once the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ not ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the flash@@ card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . first check the text that is to be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then you will also read many &amp; HTML ; lines and other invisible marks as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text that is to be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when and makes ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about events that you have set up . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , you can set up a message in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; ect@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry brings noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the stopped orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of warning .
&quot; news has the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you send from the flash@@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of lengthy texts , which do not have particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; t@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ arms , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ ts ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be more types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; ect@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string offset filters that allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) through text or for re@@ forming messages ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Converter uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ml .
&quot; for example , if you have posted a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it applies to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules don &apos;t apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; t@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters arranged . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the below directional di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; to set strings of strings you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name in any way , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column consistency and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ inser@@ tion . the list is processed in the order viewed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text application speaks one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only type copy . &quot;
&quot; the label replacement filter is applied to the text only when all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter apply if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all text . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the label replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; XML ; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can , for example , specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before a text is passed on to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features that the program provides , which gives the text to the speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ ath ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it with one click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button to the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to store or load your spokesperson settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; t@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the Voice Output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d through the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; the text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . enter a list of all commands .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ format filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you don &apos;t have this voice to read from websites . make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is issued . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option code encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string release filter . see . &quot;

&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or dep@@ rec@@ ated . therefore , consult the description of the Synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the speech synthes@@ izer program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and extend the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; t@@ ort , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ courtesy or have downloaded the actual tar@@ ball , you can compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using the speech synthes@@ izer , check first if speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user may return sentence or paragraph style , repeat , pause or break the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise automatically the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add speaker on the Add @-@ on tab , and then add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Cart@@ ridge Ad@@ visor Setup will be displayed . for example , the module for festival Inter@@ active will be displayed below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; t@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you adjust the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this grey , the voice you have chosen does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . when you check this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker installed ( or forgot to click on user ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will show the program window at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . outputs of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaker speed here . 50@@ ,@@ 50 ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ 9.@@ 95 ; % approximately twice the normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this map card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the stopped orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text application is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the outputs of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; t@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click &quot; &quot; Noti@@ fications &quot; . &quot; the flash@@ card noti@@ fications are published . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to switch the reading from &amp; k@@ ts ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; ect@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event hits . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the incoming noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; tagged ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds split text into single sentences . this allows you to start pre @-@ reading or pause , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default , a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker selecting the speaker . switch on the choice of speakers and select text to read . if you select the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s choice has been changed . you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; t@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long &quot;
&quot; if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function , you can stop or ab@@ ort text orders . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter from Ver@@ sight , you can re@@ paste it by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; t@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the flash@@ card Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection , you can over@@ write the ch@@ atter settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( top of the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; t@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to match the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the range speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the select button to use standard speakers and then use on speaker that matches the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trace tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and frac@@ tal ; it &apos;s finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , it might be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freeze &amp; t@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA may occur that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I invited an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but respect@@ fully does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / pun@@ ctu@@ al@@ int / dic@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / dic@@ ts . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules like festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card interface . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ml ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; html ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; html ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that websites are read with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; t@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l @-@ file does not reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber . same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I added a label replacement filter and now I can do in &amp; tagged ; no longer set or go back . on the Kart@@ ell orders is displayed , the order is only one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) instead . instead , use a filter for the pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by calling the command register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system is included , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; t@@ ts , the current set will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the speaker speed , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; lin@@ ux ; CDs . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded and downloaded as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball to a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a running time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
&quot; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
configure cd t@@ d mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before using the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer is working properly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; you need to compile an additional module for these voices , so you need the source code of the festival . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ Synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install the Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival of
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of the error correction is not required , you only need to re @-@ translate the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ in@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; t@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after the installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and enables the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release date . selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries can be determined permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can be viewed only , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the tab Network Interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the tab network interfaces :
the settings of selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to be edited in the device dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally selection , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously executed with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . &quot;
&quot; with the choice manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switching off a disabled network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface is available on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed , or changed . DNS entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using the Hin@@ di or Her@@ bar buttons . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be dialog editing displayed . &quot;
&quot; the List Nam@@ ed Calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of registered hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP is still in the test to replace version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
&quot; enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box to edit will appear .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , in a &amp; Con@@ sole , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given . in the second section , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section cannot replace advanced knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is taught . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator the point of contact that can be used for a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP may not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . &quot;

&quot; &amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; cle@@ ans the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ p on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detect &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ect , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; exists through a change of the symbol for the band to realize that the integration for the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be format@@ ted prior to usage , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted from the tape . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
&quot; right @-@ click on one of the archives , and select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to review . this dialog shows the progress of the audit procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that need to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
&quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select Rest@@ ore in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be watched will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same fil@@ esystem are backed up as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can do the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding method of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the tape will be dis@@ car@@ ded ; it is automatically ej@@ ected by the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the computer name : seconds , whereby the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;

&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system links the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log , is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system documents the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log , a number of useful functions . among other things , these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the log lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed , and it opens up instead of it a small message window , so you have not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually not found under Linux in the / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or returned string . in addition to the filter , the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only the log lines will be displayed , if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level indicator . the colored display of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort , you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also , find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive &quot;
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ not ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system rapidly develops the standard for controlling program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and , therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also install r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something similar to the serial port . &quot;
&quot; the kernel searches in different places after the in@@ it program , and starts the first one to find . &quot;
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default running level is 3 . if you want to change this , you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up a bit , then you come to repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have a server run@@ level that can run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network , etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry out of the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it on this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between run level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to copy them only to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area , even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine will start constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg , Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without a message if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a map card will be created where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards may appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this map only appears if there is space limitation ( quota ) enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space restrictions in each case in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
&quot; the tab group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the matching add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user resp@@ . the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to the boot of the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , remove , change and more . &quot;
