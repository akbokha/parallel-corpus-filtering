<seg id="14">"the special feature of & FSView, is to graphically present nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps provide the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportionally to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX instruction."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over to color mode, can be displayed either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is available at all, only if sufficient space for representation is present or if the area of subdivided rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with the Treemap in & FSView, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how partition the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames, so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive splitting."</seg>

<seg id="190">"the most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it fulfills the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers supply voltage jacks, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a uninterrupted power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"in addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting."</seg>

<seg id="203">"the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed. no one seems ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate internal sequences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression of the possibility to change a system in its size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and put the area you want to increase to a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new record:</seg>

<seg id="236">"open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year."</seg>
<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open gross image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. DNG is already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this may be one of the reasons why, to replace its XML-based XMP technology in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider using DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on an architecture and modeling, discussion and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>

<seg id="261">"the filenames are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names, if you upload photos of different recordings into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actual captured or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that are from your digital darkroom."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction attempt automatically to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminance factor in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balancing: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jibing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed-out images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow alignment allows you to improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set, you can save it in a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences panel will revert all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for several photos simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always requires the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you will find under colors gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & quot; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by inverting a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar stabilization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that works (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for a color film, optimized for daylight produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"when you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce the saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukforce / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the slider for the application described here. concrete the three shifters below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the control box to see how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and easy, but it creates grainy images especially in dark areas."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture blurred. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to a slight blurring. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format, however, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call this with the menu entry Correcting sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should be careful, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is much easier than sharpen. use the tool to mark softer with the menu entry Correcting softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tested. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and impression of grates will produce near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the sum represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused a picture by improving the focus. it used the copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß 'folding is influenced by the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharper is wrong. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, which later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading and compressing images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unkeyed Maskieren makes better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Wiener Filter, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result can be traced back to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob straightens the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inspection algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value flattens even in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a movie memory or CCD sounds a high value will generate wavy-like patterns. JPEG's artefacts are best removed with a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"using linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to omit it."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact in the background that caused by a poor film shift during the journey."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & edit; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, you may need to adjust the edges -filter if you change this setting."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either colour or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more distorted, but also greases the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2) .The noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen a picture. use tool to mark softer with the menu entry Correcting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's hiss, movie punches, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the texture mapping is done with another tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"reduce JPEG's artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifact & quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the Save As and Shop buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can abort the calculation at any time using the Beenden button."</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie memory on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected unter (2).</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, in particular the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but it has disadvantages too. many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which allows the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise vague effects are caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's filmenand the color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of luminance damping at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, reducing it by a small degree of vignetting."</seg>
<seg id="572">"brightness, Contrast, and Gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flatters at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the Coefficient 4th degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the distortion of the fourth degree. this value acts more strongly on the margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'Corner parameters has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thereby corrects the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">"light: this value adjusts brightness to the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion. the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the Tonnen- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. ideally, you perform this correction as first. if you cut a picture and then perform a tone-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the falsehood."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the TransCut cutting tool from the image processing or via the Zoom button of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motifs, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the toned correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image."</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for movie toning and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the option Add movie granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of movie granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter blends color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambiance from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="600">The & edit; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothes monitors the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful, if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top knob adjusts the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>

<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines starting from a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixel around a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening blurring: blurs the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary-moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then reproduces it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Beenden button.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. it gives natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can keep with the & digikam; image editing an area free of raindrops. to do this, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentrocking filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirrors or rotating."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values."</seg>
<seg id="632">"changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for that purpose. each stuttering for photo may be saved as text file, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"blowing your photo is very fast at what it does, but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Beenden button."</seg>

<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you just have to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photograph will be cut away. this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can drag a new rectangle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the blank, use the clipping button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly edited photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained."</seg>
<seg id="644">"depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation in portrait format or landscape format. in high format, the higher value of the height and the cross format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"trimming the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the editing tool the next time, these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the combination help make it possible to blend aids, so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonious triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-hand rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles with the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden divide is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third angel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is centered on the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to these lines can cause a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the Color button, you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you hold the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image processing and tool-free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">"the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences panel, you can set the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right."</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transformer cutting from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is to cut the function Automatically. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. note, however, the warning above."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformer cutting out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the shoring tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal loop e.g. will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle turns into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"shear your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>

<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats, JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first select the RAW file that is to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you intend to edit your images often or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into three areas: content, Layout, and Objective. in the following, each section is described more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first enter the title of the thumbnail and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum, HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select if a & photoalbum; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. so, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 must not download images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all of your HTML files, select a base folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first, select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:"</seg>

<seg id="930">"the settings that are just described are related to all three on base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output file."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to share your images with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & photoalbum; this work will not be done again."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images. the advantage to save all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kin file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kin file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files will be browsed. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for export images will be described, which you can access via the Export File menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>

<seg id="940">".kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not recommended to compress the files."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and what categories will match them in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database. for example, see the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray has a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to generate noise for the beam process, called jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autostereos. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered or downloaded from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) add if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>

<seg id="1538">"the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information can be obtained about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). in this case 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>

<seg id="1665">"please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards own)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is its presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map notes to the percussions channel. watch the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the Keymap option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, it will always be used patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"pitch-Bender Ratio is calculated in which pitch-Bender events multiplied. thus, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM demonstrates that there is a keyboard that will play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are being played on these keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list, where you can select an instrument. if you have modified one instrument, the button lights no more green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to view the played tones. view the view in the Settings menu under the Point Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses and quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related items are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are emoiled in the folder tree of the project, which emoclement the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously show the result to be expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check codes, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can simplify the typing by using only the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"by clicking the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the matching or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, copy them in & kdiff3; now you can copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info row of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info row has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>

<seg id="2307">"the vertical line dividing the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is scored on broken lines."</seg>

<seg id="2312">"sometimes, by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps a different source. this text will not appear in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you might copy and insert elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting the sources, ignore the options or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page up, page, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the default window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-image Abtern) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marker to clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). there is also the option Selection to copy automatically. if this is enabled, then whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is eliminated."</seg>

<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands."</seg>

<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply ignore the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you view the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first be given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut off annoying parts or correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessing command."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\ 1 /\ 1 / 'The. * is an ergular expression of the found text in one line. the\\ 1 converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">"the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they're very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessing command for newline comparisons. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and every hit will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER'Allholdings are different in perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs you only needs (and) without the '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>
<seg id="2361">"often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively."</seg>

<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded down. you can flip up a folder by double clicking on the + / - or double-click on the object. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories can be opened and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>

<seg id="2498">"it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that every mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires little practice."</seg>

<seg id="2509">"the best use is to use & kmousetool, first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should be switched off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later undo the smart move."</seg>
<seg id="2510">"if you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce & kde response times; in sounds."</seg>
<seg id="2511">"first of all, you should be aware of which parts a mouse-click does not have any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"first, you have to take out the mouse-ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"if you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape off the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"in very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool. if you use the intelligent shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of the & kmousetool, and you can continue to work as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place."</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text."</seg>
<seg id="2521">"the smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action with which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:"</seg>
<seg id="2522">"do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: execute a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while clicking the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>
<seg id="2523">"use the audible click of the mouse. this means that every time you click on a mouse click, you will know exactly when the shifting time starts. later you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"to use & kmousetool; to be able to use, the XTest extension for & X Window must be installed. that should be the case on most systems."</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">"& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome, which causes pain to be pressed."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag process to start, before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can be done with the mouse."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & tts; just one such reads, this output is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alarms, messages and text orders, as well as on & kts; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ectts; is supplied with pre-defined string offset filters that allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) through text or for reforming messages; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it applies to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules don't apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"if a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & tts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2900">"before a tape can be used, it must be formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"a band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be formatted prior to usage, this must happen before you can be formatted from the tape."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"after entering the band name and capacity, & kdat; continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>

<seg id="2915">"before you can initiate the restore, the files that need to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file on the basis of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be watched will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same filesystem are backed up as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can do the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding method of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is involved, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"is the option turned on, try & kdat; to lock the ejection in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is enabled, the tape will be discarded; it is automatically ejected by the tape. do not use this option on floppy Streamers."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the band ID. the format of this string is the computer name: seconds, whereby the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system links the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog, is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system documents the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog, a number of useful functions. among other things, these include:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the screenshot below, & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the log lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed, and it opens up instead of it a small message window, so you have not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually not found under Linux in the / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or returned string. in addition to the filter, the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only the log lines will be displayed, if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, then show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level indicator. the colored display of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort, you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;"</seg>
<seg id="2955">"& ksystemlog; also, find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive"</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & knot; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;"</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system rapidly develops the standard for controlling program starts when running the system in the & Linux; world. and, therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also install rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something similar to the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">"the kernel searches in different places after the init program, and starts the first one to find."</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default running level is 3. if you want to change this, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up a bit, then you come to repair it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have a server runlevel that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to fail to say trivial: simply drag an entry out of the range of available system services to one of the six runtime to start it on this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between run leveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to copy them only to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area, even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different work areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I've experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg, Apache and httpd) simply terminate without a message if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to start reading."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry saving in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created where you can make individual settings. other flashcards may appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes."</seg>
