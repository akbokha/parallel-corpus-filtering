&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have danced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only ampli@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in comments for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican elections was the highest number , a candidate nominated by the party ever . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tr@@ ump &apos;s view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
&quot; tr@@ ump intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency gave a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of them know are voting for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( meaning of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means whi@@ pl@@ ash injuries ) , as the big Van Jones named , killed exactly what America did so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may always have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , could have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said . &quot;
all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as Fa@@ vio something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made from recycled material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic waste dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this type on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority , was a member of a team that discovered and followed the ship at the time . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate neglect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , IU@@ U fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with information between individual countries , the actions happen in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activity or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also very attentive to the activities of ships , if they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships which fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way onto other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al register . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports . this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost every year because of the illegal fishermen entering the East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , fake license documents , specification of fantasy seeds , fishes protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ comprehen@@ sively organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You may not run my harbour &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed elu@@ sive ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that they like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find discrimin@@ atory ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization ( Oce@@ ana ) : a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each individual track@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what you are doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ra@@ ct criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to be fishing without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile registered a 33 % increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board the nets that were forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappeared by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to form the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also forced into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London , where she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is further escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to &quot; &quot; re@@ conquer the country &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of Mar@@ Ã­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum on the inaugur@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , ran into the void , when they met on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas low@@ lands , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president , Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows in her latest article : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread shortage of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example , round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , the demonstr@@ ators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : Morgen National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on November 3rd everyone to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government , according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear a skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the magnitude of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official opening procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .

&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little action against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to stop critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now speaking against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la &apos;s prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secrets to himself .
&quot; in the situation then , I believed that this was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was the police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence service department 141 in La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
records of the archive .
&quot; however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ o &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power a parent has over his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve made friends with an ERP . &quot;
don &apos;t worry that they will not guide you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
&quot; for that reason , he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym@@ nasi@@ um . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in it , and saw a lying on which men were tortured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just lying there .
&quot; they rarely bind a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty win@@ der .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that someone else can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with cu@@ ffs and were bound and tied to the eyes . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; close to the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed and killed a man there .
&quot; according to the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , it became clear to me that the boot@@ y was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that one has fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... that &apos;s not a boot@@ y , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who made cars in the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I &apos;ll find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck pul@@ lover from wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence was accused of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; when one has children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you &apos;ve been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but what will the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear for ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother who had been killed .
she was like our pet - almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
&quot; I asked myself again and again the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what will their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear for ? &quot;
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was restored , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something remains .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea to show my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt internally distra@@ cted and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Please show me now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I made the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally testified against my own father .
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was placed under house arrest pending the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :

&quot; the process lasted for more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial site headed by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license , witnessed a very mis@@ led translation last month . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &apos; ch@@ ic@@ ebo@@ x &apos; , which means &apos; older mot@@ orists &apos; , was wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area from 1st to 20th September and in the building itself .
&quot; editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is appearing in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are across the country in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter , especially un@@ named , brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on the translation error , amongst others , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to translate active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff in English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have a foreign employee , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ ned and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which originate through machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship schemes on the internet and watching television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
later other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also carried over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was bound and recommended to use the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provi@@ ders are closed again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the T@@ elec@@ oms Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission regarded it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I have signed up again with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO , VE@@ IT , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests of specific domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten when he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country . &quot;

&quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mes , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a structure published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house said proudly over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ adi@@ te one calls the more than 46@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child ob@@ tains food , an education and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice referred to as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ mean tas guaranteed not to be silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which has its daughter in the belief that she will complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; is handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mal@@ treated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ ro@@ gens in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra took on Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered a fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ gn@@ a . &quot;
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go appears in court . &quot;
the Life of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market , in order to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that her still had time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner they were done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the household library than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the master , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the owner of the house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , forced to stand next to him and to read an editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he considered it intellig@@ ently , but did not stop with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , decl@@ aring them . &quot;
&quot; however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ anes , who are exposed to Cri@@ mean &apos;s when they go to school . &quot;

hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to us .
starting from Monday if possible .
the display got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and a lot of comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot;
&quot; then , once again , the author of the show turned out to be : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

posted in public domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; Regulation of Use and Use of Social Networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register with their proper names and identity numbers on the site in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , EP deputy and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologi@@ sts ( in German &quot; Lead Cli@@ mat@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices said : &quot;
I highly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to super@@ v@@ ise the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ gent nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those guilty of threatening to &quot; threaten &quot; public order and protest . &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the c@@ amer@@ af@@ ate , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to portra@@ y a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an area .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress that has been reached in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a certain pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has yet experienced a nuclear accident , and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ building authority as well as survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
&quot; housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement homes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 per cent is the closing light . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , they still endeav@@ oured to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated homes to final replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate living in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 % of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have seriously affected the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough has been done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also raised its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people , who still dwell in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than common ground . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connecting than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , remin@@ ding themselves of a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer struck him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he hit the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush to him . &quot;
&quot; another video showing the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also featured in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has witnessed a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police attacks
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were deployed in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a platform for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ab@@ stain on violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have squ@@ ander@@ ed street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were reporting specifically about a broken glass window in order to illustrate its title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a burned @-@ in bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than on the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was left out of steel and concrete . &quot;
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves anew .
some changed the job .
&quot; other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , who still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ use his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene is very fond of having heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane mill would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsol@@ ete , and they were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories and the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that sugar could produce for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14th 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those sur@@ vey@@ ed are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first jubil@@ ee year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was the official written document , which differ@@ ed only from the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were already in operation , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important work station was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working places and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to interfere with them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people of First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop band The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is designed to encourage young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ summary First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
most cases have not been solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters had not always mastered the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop band who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is at your disposal , as is a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see them live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and also advance our youth . &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and defender of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and is re@@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic dishes ( , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the reception sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ ri@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Models of Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) are issued by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend today turns them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ ri@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new mobile tapes are decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cabinet magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an Em@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
here is an apple which holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and Lach@@ s@@ betra@@ yed are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &apos; , &apos; for &apos; # &apos; , &apos; . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chief and killed regularly only appear in statistics . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone @-@ find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people engaged in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed before and after graves , according to the people we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay her out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where are we going to get them here ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership to the international community . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
&quot; sometimes I feel like I am the only one , who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it &apos;s as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the hop@@ el@@ essness of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring location can be justified that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ dden &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four @-@ month black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats , &quot; &quot; she describes how armed criminals squ@@ ander@@ ed money from their business every month until they end up destroying not only the business , but also torn their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you &apos;ve lost , and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself if I would resolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , sau@@ te potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which it links contains pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; wrong description &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus rav@@ aged . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the fuel tank fell victim to that . &quot;
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people watching the football world championships .
houses polluted and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to the lack of knowledge .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows numbers of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals are watching them .
but the story doesn &apos;t end here .
&quot; over the years the same photo appeared several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ov@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in the streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated visually . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented allow@@ ances to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly deleted the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blows , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arabic message page fal@@ sely claimed to be President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ ches date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , some have attempted to un@@ mask the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have set out examples of abuse of use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked to one another ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
case studies of false Kop@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also demonstrate for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed by Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya has been used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a right to judge what it used as &quot; &quot; pur@@ pos@@ ely resour@@ ceful &quot; &quot; news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this rec@@ tification , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , which H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other sr@@ um ( which is often spread by Burma nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the picture of DR Congo does NOT portra@@ y Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar had admitted being in 2012 , that monks and politicians participated in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still contained in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catholic closely related message page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was released later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ary ) . but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message supposedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false . &quot;
&quot; the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , from the embassy in which the picture was contained in DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ tin also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and spor@@ adi@@ cally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only became apparent after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately might have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two main themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) , which hold these posts through . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence related to the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers no longer believe in these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ei@@ ghty people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the diffusion of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that holding back images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and take the ability to perceive em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investigated how forci@@ ble media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used in terms of context or completely impro@@ per way . &quot;
&quot; however , every examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog unveiled the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. conf@@ using ) tries to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or impossible to translate at all . &quot;
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ met@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - R@@ ise your parents in recognition of what they have done for your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after warming yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of floods and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe resi@@ dences . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama with water bo@@ oths of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the N@@ elu@@ wa was in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations , and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the occup@@ ants included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and startups have also been ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food supplies for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ ei@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ phone app Pick@@ I ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now approaching the long path to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; use approved . in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and loving friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and men , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , don &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in its conception . &quot;
they de@@ fi@@ gured me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look at all alike .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit into it , are mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
to be de@@ formed
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to delay it . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose her first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women leading movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American territory by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or based on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ backed Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in New York in 1976 .
approved use .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; at that time , when Khan re@@ thought the world sky@@ lines , my parents were foolish Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or carrying out my handy pocket organ that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread fal@@ seh@@ ood about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing ledge of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information , which has manipul@@ ated our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears the veil off a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques all over the USA , see below . &quot;

approved use .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they go back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered to her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author , when she gains an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime pos@@ ing in the 1960s . &quot;
approved use .
&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother on mother@@ ly side with her sisters , how they won a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that at this moment I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that has been col@@ oni@@ zed through a &quot; empire &quot; over the centuries , which a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tian Ost@@ ini@@ dien company has established , it has a profound significance to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an inv@@ ari@@ ably wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the risk of the game . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , armed with troops station@@ ed across every continent from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq in order to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is ha@@ unted by the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ nar@@ ative of the 1.7 billion poses more possibilities than a magic cube , but is depicted in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we reject to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , researchers at Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous sil@@ ly prints that we stand up in our news reports . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # good@@ m@@ lim@@ mer Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , a Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now running the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have led Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; others . &quot; as my girlfriend and I in the rain were doing in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake is going far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;

initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk of small and not very small languages cannot be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be part of .
&quot; while &quot; listening often to understanding , &quot; these events are &quot; &quot; making these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story in their own language first and then translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation cause the audience to listen to it . &quot;
&quot; they cry out laughing and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ben@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona , Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ben@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in : &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for new release of sovereign debt from the US
&quot; on 3 April 2017 several religious and civi@@ c organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico ; the march started in the Dominican Republic of Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;

&quot; the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts must be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to deal with decreasing pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was called &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ st@@ il sy@@ rian @-@ Palestinian web developer , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what is the real cost associated with it .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ st@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteer who has been deta@@ ined in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was d@@ ashed out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part on a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , it was contacted by people who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry trusted , a designer , a techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ tian &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ voc@@ ative than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this move into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology and taught me to use both computer and smart phones .
he taught me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care for any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , chains and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with my passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still Im cage of monsters
Bas@@ tian history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
&quot; Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , the director convic@@ ted of corruption returning to post office &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger on a case of corruption , in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants , sentenced to 22 years in prison for the disp@@ ers@@ al of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which submitted the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to receive his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many residents do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the infrin@@ gement .
&quot; the company was silent , however , and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also refuses this behavior and considers the case as &quot; re@@ fut@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had served . &quot;
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches ; he could advise and polish his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
re@@ vo@@ cable !
&quot; bit one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have mor@@ ale : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted it . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way , that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as being an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , prefers to recall that a th@@ ief is part of the prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remain in memory of the Mos@@ ambique , not only as the first independent president , but also as sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he energe@@ tically affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , including the father@@ land for his ambition to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and escaped . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der b@@ ins .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; M@@ ust &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely absor@@ bing con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether or not they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words next to it . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat has shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I banned the li@@ king , posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intent or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work like that . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied messages . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ orship has provided much mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech , but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the region of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the prolifer@@ ous hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ended with child@@ birth
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child@@ birth is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ y Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , which had already been married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ avor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for the marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; however , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condem@@ ning themselves for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point there were doubts whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for child@@ birth had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who has held a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? it &apos;s now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was thinking that it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ ist @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : news , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the law of the marriage has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft amend@@ ment to the marriage law was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 representatives in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all the de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , to@@ dd@@ lers are no longer allowed by law . &quot;
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # Car@@ rier abuse .
many thanks to all the activists they fought for .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible tick comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan , Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to release his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the subject in a different way . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; sat , if we , instead of discussing so generally speaking , in a way that can only indu@@ ce panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply talk about that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used from large , hard @-@ boiled men , would be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit it . &quot;
hack@@ ers un@@ roll the Office of the State Forest against nation @-@ wide protests at the Russian National Day

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the page - but it remained in the cache . &quot;
it &apos;s a pity !
&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ news local news service that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many engineering @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use circum@@ fer@@ ential tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , to be called out . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we made it possible to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ ck@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project , that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one attacks another URL which is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia for yourself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a Su@@ h@@ len@@ dy N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when I suddenly shou@@ ted to Navar@@ ro ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Lake Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to cra@@ ckle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood by face to face to Tig@@ ers , saying , &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ ck appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that , due to social pressure , they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm respecting this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a Court of Appe@@ al and viol@@ ated by her family and community , after having addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of keeping their wives also not known by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them on which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the discussion on the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to speak lou@@ dly on the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ old and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; initially , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to engage the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ Ã¯@@ pt from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed the name of their hus@@ bands to pronoun@@ ce . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only smoked over the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole beg@@ ging fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead , showing the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red dot , if he would do it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place to exchange ideas and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out to the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have worn only sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of her own dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of tas ( shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
so far we have only made small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead at any time .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their life - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the Beat@@ les &apos;s official YouTube channel .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les Day &quot; &quot; was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is seen as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it quickly became clear to the people that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; they were here in Tokyo for 51 years . &quot;
&quot; today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kara@@ oke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , the Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan base from the market , like this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
that is how the day is going to run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could attack Mos@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for ab@@ original purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can ab@@ stain from gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of sub@@ ordination for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique with bald men , target ritual attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably dis@@ believ@@ able rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also insti@@ gates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating riches . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha commented on Facebook the Chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ Ã¯@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country where people would be ashamed to seek sex against good marks , and women would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald ones are hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some did not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; T@@ sar Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ek , and also the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ st@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences towards his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ st@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
Bas@@ sels &apos; stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
&quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity as a pioneer of the open web movement show the honor . &quot;
and we appl@@ aud the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the start of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was presumably taken only recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Risk ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokesman told that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives appeals from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some responses from abroad .
United Nations ( United Nations )
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this will ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ ch shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treating abroad insofar as he helped him in his recovery .
&quot; announ@@ cing the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy ur@@ ges Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Dr. AF@@ P previously reported that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release those for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France - France
&quot; in an explanation on June 29 , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will ultimately accept it . &quot;
Taiwan and the United Kingdom
the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called upon China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June to Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party , because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately no land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the central point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised these questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the cap@@ tion .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as leader of an advancing generation who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes he is right and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review disman@@ tles the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; commit good faith &quot; a mistake , or was it a Freu@@ dian driver ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , to which country are the sovereign rights of Singapore back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their town , but not their country ? &quot;
who must our prime minister pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country above all , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in anger if they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , are ... . &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant of ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d confused me with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ ici@@ ous - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence around the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau acted on stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite their promise to re @-@ establish the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta regime . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , referring to some of the political topics which Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of the &quot; change of imagination &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes persons accused of slan@@ dering the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is strictly speaking against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Dis@@ closure ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup of the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment store , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ach@@ as@@ an war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the Gulf of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Saint @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and settlements live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely gone over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v @-@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty residents live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still houses one or two families , is recognized by the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both of them seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately retreat . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to let ourselves be photographed , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district office supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if you are a holiday , we will visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , it reminds of the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia &apos;s land just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation turns to an end , a little boy ad@@ mits to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which cares for un@@ restra@@ int in their lives . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,@@ 50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez talks , people come to full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; he rep@@ lies smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez talks that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have contributed to making chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; wife Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ru@@ gs on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she is trying to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the passages , the travellers always consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she fli@@ rts with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
but the authorities also managed to use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books , and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and monitoring measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants random@@ ly , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &apos; Nom@@ inal St@@ ation@@ ship &apos; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all branches of government , government and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is , three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; S@@ leep or Death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and discover that you are all alone in a place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has cast down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough for the city to destroy the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all the districts encountered , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands on a city that is ad@@ mon@@ ished to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
&quot; I interrupted the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; several times from my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to unite .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that fulfilled all my expectations . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment , you realize that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I do now .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out when we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled with hate for me .
and you really mo@@ urn what to look at me and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately . &quot;
&quot; his father , with them . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is in my nose to this day .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was suspended for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ ede all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share them with just one more prisoner , and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell mate was a &quot; first resp@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we &apos;re all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists within us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence , in order to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man , at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have got used to it not to respond .
I can really no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot;
on penalty in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t give him enough , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal office equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable , from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
I had lost all sen@@ timent in my body - and also my voice why I stopped scre@@ aming .
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why it resor@@ ted to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible troubles . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch . &quot;
&quot; however , what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ stained lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version to American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Second Generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b points out . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he pour Nes@@ cafÃ© dissolved in water into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time , it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gn@@ ats speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sen@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to adopt &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement would probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting an increasingly clear @-@ out reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently rec@@ ited woman , whose arms and legs stretch towards the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; honour kill@@ ers &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still alar@@ ming that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be deta@@ ined at an in@@ definite time in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that the woman is not going to happen . &quot;
&quot; even H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from topics , which in his country long as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ tim@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b , &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse recur@@ sively repe@@ ats itself quite often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a modified version , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ de , who should later work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they had raised concerns in social media comments on the problems connected with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of how millions of other Arabs also dream of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until then , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ ke and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ti@@ fications , the drums and dancing have been mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years and come from a time in which armies were mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en again for a long time : two for@@ ts are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a car of 18 metres was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street @-@ rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens to move into the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an education in the art of hair sty@@ ling instead of bad advice , which enabled them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; prior to the school year beginning in March , the school offered special educational workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ kind of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published . &quot;
this article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ? &quot;
this is exactly what the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation did not leave the head and inspired them to write letters to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aciÃ³n Campa@@ ign ( letters to reconciliation ) which encourage young people to write letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ erri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sign of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who have been living in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now accept them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian had to join together and help the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he talked about sharing his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former comb@@ at@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&apos;@@ i never imagined that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set up the way they did before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters of full use of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and put me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; maybe he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there who is waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to begin with , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered for a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
&quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have witnessed the social injustice by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who have never been heard before and had no right to vote , and recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is painful to me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former comb@@ at@@ ants responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , protest and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs up like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sh@@ aber on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q law@@ suit in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published describing the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
she felt she was a woman in reality since her childhood .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the sex adaptation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just taking a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you are stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
&quot; then I lost consciousness , and eventually woke up in the hospital . &quot;
apparently some women had everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which wings have you been laid , in the men &apos;s or the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and placed me among the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me with respect .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad news , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she took a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; luckily , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate plate with a 95 on it stood under the window . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something bad . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering , without ID , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be safe just because you &apos;ve left the country ? &quot;
our people already know what hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditionally cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , I still carry in me . &quot;
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually bother to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who remain dor@@ t@@ t ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who has sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced satisfaction with blood . &quot;
OC Media : will gay men still be held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me that there weren &apos;t so many .
&quot; if , then above all , those who do not have enough relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to present themselves to Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are kept there so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is that just a guess , or do you have a source of this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , and there have been no reports about it until now . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known all over the world when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never even bent my hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , was a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; L@@ otte not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they thought you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased me , never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
&quot; who had laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed , looked at you once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you start now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize tea riffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for that .
I discovered these people myself when I disper@@ sed the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys in them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they are - but &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is uncomfortable for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transitions to men who love men , and they believe that you are changing your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab An@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared to YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people made it quick to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August inside the Arab An@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have caught up this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ ots , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable farm land for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s running water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks has now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian CEO for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % completed a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; because function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation explo@@ des . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who themselves call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black women women , on black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used by racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement decide to keep silent about white female fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are faced with black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
&quot; or , that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ divided and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that , moreover , absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and sex , because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to reward them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dissolve myself completely from femin@@ ism and join me in the movement of femin@@ ism , which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ ans : recur@@ sion ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of being able to define ourselves in this way also spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither ignored , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has repeatedly traveled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one of Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; her work focuses on poorly developed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rie@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ husband , who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman appeared to Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , the official announcement of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez didn &apos;t help . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman retired . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; in general , if women have been ref@@ unded at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 be@@ atings and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system , which nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ ms , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even point to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office issued 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of women were shown here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not &quot; &quot; do this , &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 on every woman who will be ref@@ unded for physical abuse . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own crime , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay on account of violence by men . &quot;
&quot; a sign saying : &quot; &quot; without complic@@ ity no imp@@ unity . &quot; &quot; # Non@@ linear &quot; &quot; photo by Jes@@ sie Is@@ fr@@ an PÃ©@@ rez . use with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which does not &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she didn &apos;t give up . she should regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had let Carlos please so long and did not leave him in the past .
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was ab@@ using her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I Beli@@ eve You &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victoria case everything started with mental ab@@ uses .
&quot; after all , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without results and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she introduced a process against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for@@ you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os move are part of a campaign endor@@ sed by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent off@@ ence and punish tough@@ er as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the law text was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law who feared that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which are currently banned in Paraguay and are pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which the victims of violence have to bear themselves , if they just want to refund and receive a secure housing , to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the off@@ ence of perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
we must report such a long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after ban on a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of press , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Committee of Edi@@ tors , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS appointed Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor in chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining &quot; &quot; of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3000 Afgh@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after being found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit amoun@@ ting to $ 5000 was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after finishing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his annual prison sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the Court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Ottoman government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with what the Minister made another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to authori@@ ze publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom has been viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the Catalan authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial troubles . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and the lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , the research done by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; furthermore , I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GV : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a cre@@ ators ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for specialized scientific training , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make items accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ Wall ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com site , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ Wonder , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many salad sorts he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
&quot; patents were not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cro@@ oked leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I must add@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the United States and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( open source re@@ ins ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red Roman salad of the Out@@ red@@ Wonder variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software . &quot;
&quot; it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and so are permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut them out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ enced professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to them , seed plays a role in greater coher@@ ence such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , taking part in the increasingly frequent amal@@ gam@@ ation of crops in the global agricultural industry , which , for example , is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking because of the growing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the cart@@ el characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either not or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are pat@@ ter@@ ned in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of View@@ ing
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much less predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson on C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ etes promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; so , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but fo@@ sters it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : wait 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make their work easier for farmers .
this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; anyone who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation would be required to produce masses of her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties . &quot;
my concept is just opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as move to international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need new material for my catalog all the time , as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the USA seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a form@@ id@@ able and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled start @-@ up will be scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - publishes a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisations and blog are the latest cens@@ orship objectives in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ble@@ w in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who should defend the law and to give victims a voice , even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles he did not write to websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog he set up in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is resident , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the government and reflected what it meant for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; a arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs and any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have an influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courageous go the way through to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers by circum@@ vent@@ ing Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; the situation is further worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship , and who will attack it next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; daily newspaper titles from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 troops of the army , Navy and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 spiral of violence reached its highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice has even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; on August 16 , the paper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio de Janeiro released the editorial &quot; That &apos;s not normal , &quot; in which she announced plans to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that is devi@@ ating from the civili@@ zed standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video sharing on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a military ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist reports that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it protects ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the contrary , ar@@ gues the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education , and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and northeast of the country , according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the murder rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia pointed out , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , however , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . after several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police came up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : learn besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ did@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly loyal to the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 required hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on the investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebels outside Damascus , which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smu@@ g@@ gled foods . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting for announ@@ cing this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the writing of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm &quot; for the region .
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; : breaking of the siege .
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities linked to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days a state shower .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia area in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded by fires . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &apos; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread over the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to limit the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in places with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val , in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , always spread further after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided information to the population , using the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade , and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the Afgh@@ an invasion started through the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the dawn , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that , due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still take months after the asylum application has been registered . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible expectation of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Lux@@ ury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ an operating companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have emerged . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afghanistan .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and retail and aim to reach the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ aph made this journey himself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : bill accus@@ ations from Egypt enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration at a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting a successful legislative decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty parliamentary members , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another Member of the Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who captured Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who were arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a court appointment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until May 20 , because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ exposure of among others weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists on backed @-@ up documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s independent media platform and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated to a failed plan of action . said plans from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly support a controversial bill of law , which would grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document , published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on April 21 , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans appear to support the bill . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the designation of his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China intend to force the users of social media to present their IDs ?
&quot; according to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that the registration will be necessary with the full real name . &quot;
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversation within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; organis@@ er of information spread . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to charge said services to remove content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ oz@@ nik ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after wi@@ ki@@ pedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has announced that the site has been closed because it is &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to provoke a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is therefore , in addition to inter alia , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
UK can &apos;t stop puff@@ ing
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation lasts until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
