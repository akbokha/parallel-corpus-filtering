<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was it, as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only amplified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in comments for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number, a candidate nominated by the party ever."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trump's view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency gave a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of them know are voting for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(meaning of the whites against all other ethnicities," white and whiplash, which means whiplash injuries), as the big Van Jones named, killed exactly what America did so splendidly. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may always have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, could have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump Land, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">All the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular with tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with gleaming eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made from recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic waste dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles rapidly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority, was a member of a team that discovered and followed the ship at the time."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the plundering of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate neglect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, IUU fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with information between individual countries, the actions happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activity or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also very attentive to the activities of ships, if they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships which fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way onto other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a penal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lost every year because of the illegal fishermen entering the East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions like sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specification of fantasy seeds, fishes protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-comprehensively organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You may not run my harbour'."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed elusive ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system designed to help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that they like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find discriminatory ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization (Oceana): a platform that offers satellite data and which can display the position of each individual trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what you are doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detract criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to be fishing without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile registered a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licences."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board the nets that were forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappeared by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined forces to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also combat illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "With security, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also forced into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a particular collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London, where she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me for the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in it, and saw a lying on which men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a person with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was appalling... like a dirty winder.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that someone else can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with cuffs and were bound and tied to the eyes."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"close to the entrance, people kept quiet on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, there were some rooms that were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero collapsed and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera trial, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>

<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'booty'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all possible stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as it called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was later in the military, I was in the gendarmerie, it became clear to me that the booty was a bayonet or perhaps military sign that one has fought against."</seg>

<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied," "And you, who made cars in the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I'll find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a turtleneck pullover from wool. both had my dad from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes to home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence was accused of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay a burden on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last heinous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"when one has children, one recognizes the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you've been executing people during the dictatorship, but what will the corpses disappear for?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap your children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with his mother who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet - almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">"I asked myself again and again the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but what will their corpses disappear for?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was restored, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea to show my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt internally distracted and asked myself why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "which they allegedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he answered," "Please show me now." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I made the first ad."</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can blame me for being biased. I finally testified against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license, witnessed a very misled translation last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a shield, the Japanese word 'chicebox', which means' older motorists', was wrongly - perhaps also with malicious hind thoughts & # 8212; as" awful motorists. ""</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which is appearing in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto, simply unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was first removed. the name" "dangerous drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, even grammatically correct term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely feel that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are across the country in accidents is quite a matter of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to translate active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff in English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-finding or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have a foreign employee, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worned and enigmatic sentences, which originate through machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations."</seg>

<seg id="418">"Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family, who lived there."</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house said proudly over her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began working as a criadita for the family. as a criadite one calls the more than 466,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange the child obtains food, an education and a roof above the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice referred to as criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society, and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Crimean tas guaranteed not to be silent in general."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, which has its daughter in the belief that she will complete her education, improve her position in society and" make something out of itself, "is handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is maltreated, his family will experience it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the borrogens in paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira took on Marín as long as she suffered a fatal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvargna. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>

<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>

<seg id="455">"the Crimean tas are not only exploited as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his job."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street, or on the market, in order to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a criadita to the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time so that her still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner they were done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on" "Regulation of Use and Use of Social Networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by the Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is mandated to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, users would have to register with their proper names and identity numbers on the site in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, EP deputy and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologists (in German" Lead Climatologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), Global Voices said:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I highly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to supervise the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no divergent narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress that has been reached in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was a certain prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima prefecture has yet experienced a nuclear accident, and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese re-building authority as well as survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement homes (" "" "" "" "" "" "" "saigai kouei juchaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima with 70 per cent is the closing light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, they still endeavoured to relocate evacuated homes to final replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate living in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the people evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 out of 1100 schools affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98% of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have seriously affected the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima are located in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here again Fukushima remains far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level, as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough has been done in catastrophes prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also raised its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 people evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima are still living outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated people, who still dwell in shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding was left out of steel and concrete."</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">"other resigned and commuting daily to the factories, who still grind."</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rouse his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene is very fond of having heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane mill would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsolete, and they were hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories and the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that sugar could produce for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will surely go into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero. "</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began."</seg>
<seg id="654">"in the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14th 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is" "scam." ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently."</seg>
<seg id="664">"Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters." "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were already in operation," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important work station was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives for working places and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they were located."</seg>

<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to visit other factories."</seg>

<seg id="690">Capture a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people of First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it by hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop band The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is designed to encourage young participants to explore topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the Kitsummary First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also" highway of tears, "a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most cases have not been solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is in spite of the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters had not always mastered the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop band who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is at your disposal, as is a translation into English which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see them live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"thus, they can grow and also advance our youth."</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the reception shokuhin gentriu (" "Plastic Models of Courts" ") are issued by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter part of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend today turns them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin gentriu."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes are decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cooling cabinet magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an Emen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">Here is an apple which holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and Lachsbetrayed are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the mischief and killed regularly only appear in statistics."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind each bone-find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking "), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people engaged in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how afraid life changes" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priest:" like every Sunday, we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed before and after graves, according to the people we have loved to seek. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>

<seg id="767">"on October 13, he left the house."</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay her out because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where are we going to get them here? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "render a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the conflicts, fragility and state leadership to the international community."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel like I am the only one, who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it's as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone, and those who fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the hopelessness of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring location can be justified that they were" "sodden". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they will be spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" "Four-month blackmail in the capital district: how a family was looted with threats," "she describes how armed criminals squandered money from their business every month until they end up destroying not only the business, but also torn their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">"you think of everything you've lost, and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days."</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are away from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kill you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked myself if I would resolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, saute potatoes, tortillas warm and" "Chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office numbered 3103 murders."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its initial release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" "wrong description" "or" "false context" "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus ravaged. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the fuel tank fell victim to that."</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people watching the football world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses polluted and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to the lack of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows numbers of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But the story doesn't end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo appeared several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Govon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in the streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one left to count corpses," "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated visually."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented allowances to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly deleted the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi-Arabic message page falsely claimed to be President of Myanmar's Thein Sein, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate this information."</seg>

<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and does the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The diffusion of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that holding back images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and take the ability to perceive empathy (such as this study, which investigated how forcible media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used in terms of context or completely improper way."</seg>

<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>

<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk of small and not very small languages cannot be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to be part of.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening often to understanding, "these events are" "making these events instead" "listening to appreciate, to feel, to link."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers put their story in their own language first and then translate or explain it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and representation cause the audience to listen to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they cry out laughing and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyambenara tells the tale of the rabbits and the baboon in the language of Shona, Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyambenara is asked," How is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "he shares his sense of inclusiveness with a wide grin:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017 several religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico; the march started in the Dominican Republic of Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-fixing of the debt also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debts must be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to deal with decreasing pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation, proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside will be jeopardized without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was called "Night Vigil for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, dedicated an event to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: collective research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available royalty free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what is the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartstil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was dashed out of the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on October 3, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "Bassel had taken part on a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, it was contacted by people who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its whereabouts and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry trusted, a designer, a technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastian's cultural prototypes was more provocative than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this move into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology and taught me to use both computer and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mosambicans reacted with anger on a case of corruption, in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this was Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 years in prison for the dispersal of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which submitted the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to receive his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many residents do not welcome the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company was silent, however, and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also refuses this behavior and considers the case as" refutable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had served."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches; he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spider bins.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Must" "(in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely absorbing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether or not they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words next to it."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(splitting bsen)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat has shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word in order to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I banned the liking, posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail" "didn't meet the Facebook community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of messages from people who have no negative intent or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work like that."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified messages."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook censorship has provided much mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech, but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post states" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the region of Rakhine, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to take control of the proliferous hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypery Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group representing representatives of various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors as," every man under the age of 18. ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"the statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, which had already been married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements endeavored to abolish laws for the marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"however, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemning themselves for their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this uncomplicated situation, and at some point there were doubts whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">"now, only the president of the country must agree and announce the law."</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:"</seg>

<seg id="1357">"having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for childbirth had finally been changed.</seg>

<seg id="1364">"minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!!"</seg>
<seg id="1365">"Folade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the draft amendment to the marriage law was approved today, on June 9, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 representatives in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the deputies agreed to have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in Trinidad and Tobago, toddlers are no longer allowed by law."</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # Carrier abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists they fought for.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"but a possible tick comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan, Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organization of the country."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to release his promise now."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"while the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the subject in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"sat, if we, instead of discussing so generally speaking, in a way that can only induce panic and disgrace, if we, instead of speaking of the problem, would simply talk about that the state, which protects our daughters from being abused from large, hard-boiled men, would be willing to continue the discussion?"</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">"but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child's marriage is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that prohibit it."</seg>

<seg id="1390">"by mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again"</seg>
<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for more than a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many engineering-savvy Internet users are used to use circumferential tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007, after the Internet law (no. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which is not based on the domain name system, making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content is, in spite of legal prohibition, to be called out."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we made it possible to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansickpe.org, an open source project, that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorsites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attacks another URL which is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server further directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia for yourself if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a Suhlendy Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his home town right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract attention to Neptune's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly shouted to Navarro (the manager of the Chitwan Lake Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood by face to face to Tigers, saying,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Buck appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares at me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wild animals is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1468">"CC BY-NC 2.0,"</seg>
<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead they use a pronoun or say" "father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that, due to social pressure, they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm respecting this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a Court of Appeal and violated by her family and community, after having addressed a married relatives with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of keeping their wives also not known by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, performed a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them on which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the Community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pais has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices, such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was of women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the discussion on the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak loudly on the names of their husbands is a custom, which they all dutifully uphold and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially, Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to engage the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," "says Rohini Païpt from the village Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never allowed the name of their husbands to pronounce."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only smoked over the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole begging frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"over the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead, showing the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red dot, if he would do it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place to exchange ideas and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out to the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage-kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of her own dress code, morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of tas (shirts) into a discussion round so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their life - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "news of those who experience it", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1549">"on June 29th of this year, the hashtag" "The Beatles Day" "was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles."</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is seen as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">"the first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:"</seg>
<seg id="1552">"for just under five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through."</seg>
<seg id="1553">It quickly became clear to the people that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"the music of the cult band is" more than just a universal language like English, "Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review."</seg>

<seg id="1562">"and as it is for fans, the Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places associated with the band."</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the population that bald men could attack Mosambique's target of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"photo: other Bolin / Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, presumably for aboriginal purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can abstain from gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that consecutive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the aim of subordination for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"the persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices."</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>

<seg id="1597">"two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place."</seg>
<seg id="1598">"Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:"</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mordecabala, province of Zambézia, for presumably disbelievable rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also instigates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating riches."</seg>
<seg id="1601">"in the last days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country."</seg>
<seg id="1602">"on Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha commented on Facebook the Chronicle of the Bloggers poor Sïppa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of Mozambique:"</seg>
<seg id="1603">"I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambik, THE SME is ashamed of a country where people would be ashamed to seek sex against good marks, and women would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald ones are hunted for indulgent purposes or" black magic.

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(State Risk), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and a spokesman told that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China still receives appeals from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue."</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations (United Nations)</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this will ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>

<seg id="1665">"Dr. AFP previously reported that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>

<seg id="1674">"the Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called upon China to allow the ill-intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June to Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party, because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately no land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the central point of the subject, the good old lyre comes up again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised these questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the caption.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country," he obviously did not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of an advancing generation who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes he is right and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review dismantles the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr Shanmugam" commit good faith "a mistake, or was it a Freudian driver?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, to which country are the sovereign rights of Singapore back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their town, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade tends to Bejahung, Singapore, and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country above all, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be spicious - just like the good-natured, gentle yet tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>

<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez talks, people come to full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with their daughter Merrui who has a yoghurchin) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "he replies smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez talks that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have contributed to making chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"wife Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on rugs on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she is trying to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passages, the travellers always consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she flirts with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots, which she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeated them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users" "" "stewards" ""</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi have received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities also managed to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information, "including videos, images, eBooks, and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme engravings and monitoring measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China "based on Twitter, which publishes censored news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants randomly, whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ('Nominal Stationship') also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all branches of government, government and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis, three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable, both inside and outside."</seg>

<seg id="1998">One that has cast down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the Earth continues on the axis of the evil. you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but this was not enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the Chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"during a peaceful protest, five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to destroy the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the districts encountered, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was silent, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not set high demands on a city that is admonished to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I interrupted the silence by shouting" "Allahu Akbar" "several times from my house-roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to unite.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we were allied to a sumptuous picture that fulfilled all my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"at such a moment, you realize that you release the spirit from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I do now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"Colonel Ghassan starts to speak:" let me hear how you cry "Allahu Akbar," or you are only courageous enough to shout when we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes filled with hate for me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you really mourn what to look at me and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, with them."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed proposition is in my nose to this day.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture that I was suspended for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I concede all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with just one more prisoner, and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried communication method: to strike with the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell mate was a "first respite."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after long hesitation, he finally answered me."</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle-aged man who looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we're all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have had a scarecrow to drive out all these crows, which labelled on the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the betrayer and the terrorists within us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"it is a curse that they call coexistence, in order to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man, at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the expressions that derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have got used to it not to respond.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer tell exactly when insults and punches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On penalty in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionately "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure with him, and you cannot hold back your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams didn't give him enough, so they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal office equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable, from their point of view."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all sentiment in my body - and also my voice why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why it resorted to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply my entire district."</seg>

<seg id="2081">I decided to go to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>

<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world with his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion to American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian Refugees of the Second Generation, "even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib points out. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while he pour Nescafé dissolved in water into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time, it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gnats speak lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Seno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to adopt" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement would probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflecting an increasingly clear-out reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently recited woman, whose arms and legs stretch towards the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of" honour killers "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still alarming that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be detained at an indefinite time in prison", "and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that the woman is not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"even Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from topics, which in his country long as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib, "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse recursively repeats itself quite often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a modified version," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is campaigning openly for the LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nude, who should later work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had raised concerns in social media comments on the problems connected with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams of how millions of other Arabs also dream of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind of democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until then, Hdaib will continue to rake and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the fortifications, the drums and dancing have been marched over more than a thousand years and come from a time in which armies were marched from the west of Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gayoen again for a long time: two forts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street-robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens to move into the seasoned hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an education in the art of hair styling instead of bad advice, which enabled them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"prior to the school year beginning in March, the school offered special educational workshops and reported on some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" "Liebeskind of guerrilla fighters", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation did not leave the head and inspired them to write letters to the Carta por la-liación Campaign (letters to reconciliation) which encourage young people to write letters to guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the sign of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrillas, who have been living in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now accept them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian had to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he talked about sharing his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse of a war story a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up the way they did before in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters of full use of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered:" "hello, what are they doing right now?" "he said," "I'll answer a letter someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him completely, and put me beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there who is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to begin with, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have witnessed the social injustice by the state to the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who have never been heard before and had no right to vote, and recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is painful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, protest and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the coverage of the recent months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs up like a Damoklesshaber on the LGBTQ community there has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ lawsuit in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published describing the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt she was a woman in reality since her childhood.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned about the sex adaptation of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she ultimately moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just taking a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "how long will you still honor the family, you are stain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"then I lost consciousness, and eventually woke up in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which wings have you been laid, in the men's or the women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and placed me among the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"for this, I am very grateful to him."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to return to Chechnya, to prove that all was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad news, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she took a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"luckily, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, a car with darkened window panes and a plate plate with a 95 on it stood under the window."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something bad."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without ID, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you're going to be safe just because you've left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditionally caucasian elements, I still carry in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually bother to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who remain dortt?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced satisfaction with blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will gay men still be held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me that there weren't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all, those who do not have enough relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to present themselves to Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are kept there so that they can later be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is that just a guess, or do you have a source of this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, and there have been no reports about it until now. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known all over the world when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to introduce us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never even bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, was a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Lotte not over the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they thought you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never chased me, never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had laughed before and laughed, looked at you once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you start now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize tea riffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I dispersed the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no gays in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, they are - but" "not in Chechnya." ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is uncomfortable for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you are changing your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Anwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared to YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people made it quick to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August inside the Arab Anwazi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have caught up this month."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriots, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi-community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable farm land for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams running water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian CEO for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% completed a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohii, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men. "</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"because functionaries and institutions prefer not to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation explodes."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectional not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who themselves call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused by racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement decide to keep silent about white female feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to" lift up their voices "and" Kumbaya, my Lord, "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are faced with black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an undivided and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that, moreover, absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex, because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to reward them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectionalism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to dissolve myself completely from feminism and join me in the movement of feminism, which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womans: recursion (example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of being able to define ourselves in this way also spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither ignored, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa has repeatedly traveled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work on a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one of Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"her work focuses on poorly developed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay". "the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# Weilicheinefriebin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-husband, who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman appeared to Balbuena for maltreatment, the official announcement of Ada Báez didn't help."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman retired."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"in general, if women have been refunded at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 beatings and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system, which nothing undernimmt3 Paraguayan laws: good approach, inadequate implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Ems, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that do not even point to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecutor's Office issued 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of women were shown here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not" "do this," "she stated at the end of 2014 on every woman who will be refunded for physical abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own crime, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay on account of violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign saying:" "without complicity no impunity." "# Nonlinear" "photo by Jessie Isfran Pérez. use with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">"invisible mistreatment and a judicial system, which does not"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she didn't give up. she should regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos, but for two years she endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had let Carlos please so long and did not leave him in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse, at least, had a certain complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was abusing her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" I Believe You "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria case everything started with mental abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities stayed without results and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she introduced a process against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay Law: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but are not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# foryou)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos move are part of a campaign endorsed by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid to an independent offence and punish tougher as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the law text was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law who feared that the road for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which are currently banned in Paraguay and are punishable by up to five years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with his agreement"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and the lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, the research done by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sámi healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstanding of the media about this research."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"furthermore, I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a creators ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for specialized scientific training, beginning at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines can only make items accessible against payment (the so-called PayWall), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com site, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as OutredWonder, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many salad sorts he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents were not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crooked leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants, such as grain or cartons."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must addaddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented." "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the United States and around the world: open source Breeding (open source reins).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red Roman salad of the OutredWonder variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright-protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and so are permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut them out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerienced professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to them, seed plays a role in greater coherence such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says, taking part in the increasingly frequent amalgamation of crops in the global agricultural industry, which, for example, is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds freely to others, in contrast to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking because of the growing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the cartel characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either not or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are patterned in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Viewing</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much less predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson on Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varietetes promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"so, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but fosters it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: wait 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make their work easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" anyone who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation would be required to produce masses of herbicides, which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as move to international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need new material for my catalog all the time, as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the USA seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formidable and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled start-up will be scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - publishes a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to HRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles he did not write to websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog he set up in order to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is resident, on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced the government and reflected what it meant for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"a arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking blogs and any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have an influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"furthermore, afte documented the blocking of providers by circumventing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is further worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 spiral of violence reached its highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice has even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on August 16, the paper" Extra "published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio de Janeiro released the editorial" That's not normal, "in which she announced plans to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that is deviating from the civilized standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the heading" War in Rio.

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video sharing on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper, stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a military rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist reports that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:"</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it protects?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the contrary, argues the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education, and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, however, this led to a decrease of violent deaths. after several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also entails serious consequences for the people."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, chiefly loyal to the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 required hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on the investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel areas have been besieged by rebels outside Damascus, which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smuggled foods."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"right of the project, Abo Nabil, said AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years he has been fighting for announcing this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila at Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the writing of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €but will continue to raise funds to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began with the" production of fungal seeds coming from the regions, "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm" for the region.</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout the Eastern Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons": breaking of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Providing a new food source in the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">"spread a culture of self-sufficiency by using food leftovers (such as paper, tea, coffee, cardboard, etc.) for the extraction of new foods."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days a state shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia area in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded by fires."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Bund der Farmers of Portugal declared Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the roads were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits are questioned in places with a high risk of fire."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval, in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, always spread further after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">"it was a private initiative that provided information to the population, using the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires."</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Ashark came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that, due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still take months after the asylum application has been registered."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible expectation of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>

<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of Afghan operating companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have emerged."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2937">"under the law, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, such as legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who captured Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants, who were arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a court appointment."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed until May 20, because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-exposure of among others weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi seats on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists on backed-up documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of Nawaat's independent media platform and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a failed plan of action. said plans from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly support a controversial bill of law, which would grant businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if they return all unlawful monies."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document, published on the Nawaat website on April 21, sheds light on how the Presidential plans appear to support the bill."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia rejected the designation of his sources, stating the article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China intend to force the users of social media to present their IDs?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in addition, it is stated in the rules that the registration will be necessary with the full real name."</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversation within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>

<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as" organiser of information spread. ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"this designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to charge said services to remove content and to force it on request to suspend user data."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"these websites are currently websites such as Vkontakte and Odnooznik (Russia's two popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services."</seg>

<seg id="2964">"a Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is therefore, in addition to inter alia, China, one of the few countries around the world, in which access to Wikipedia is not possible."</seg>
