this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly , that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally transferred blu@@ epr@@ ints for an atomic bomb to Iran .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and sp@@ ying journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been saying for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of reti@@ ring and ris@@ king , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone calls secretly , &quot;
&quot; just like its email data , financial and banking information , credit information , and even travel with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than any US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers coming to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source release system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , as is the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure more information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to commit wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental worker , the alarm for contaminated water from Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warns us against the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers can go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others , who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next exposed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a spy or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems weeping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
media and leading politicians in the whole world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fas@@ cists . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presumably , because until now there were no prominent Americans who appeared in these revelations expos@@ ing this scandal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer ameri@@ can customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information in order to create a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked that all , up to one lawyer , made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an isolated case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound very stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that some things have started to change . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen steps towards greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central tab@@ s at the national level who really lies behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind this .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in the two parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use legislation to end this type of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an auction sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that , he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what brought me in there ? &quot;
a stranger slept in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at ti@@ spi@@ kes to the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to host people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer &apos;s bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a store that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you concentrate on the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your un@@ locked cell phone with your left seat neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; for example , most guests feel like they spend the night somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone now ? &quot;
could you please tell Twitter that he is runner @-@ up for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would first introduce himself to his name , if he had told where he came from , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 testim@@ oni@@ als , all say , &quot; &quot; He can really stick to very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
&quot; in the beginning , we made some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to reject negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
not surprisingly we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by testim@@ oni@@ als .
&quot; if you have fewer than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out in common .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one can tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with what we hadn &apos;t reck@@ oned with , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered beforehand . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is going very well . &quot;
of course there are also times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my cell phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence broke .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for men have confidence in one another .
&quot; when trust works , miracles can come about . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
what is the idea of sharing with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
&quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait for a group there to thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and to show a quarter where you &apos;ve never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , homes are designed based on the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; now , students who were looking for a place to stay were offered . &quot;
&quot; they were taught to people whose children had grown up , incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality had already existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in securing the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk about their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ t@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ te me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion to deep@@ en each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and begin post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went -- as we were silent -- as deep as we went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , who said , &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ep in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sil@@ enced . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again , the warnings came : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and sm@@ ashed into free . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have pushed the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; maybe a few parking spaces will be released , but will not stop the terror . &quot;
regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to seeing people more tolerant of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ thing group thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen off by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we have to stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; holy scriptures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister , with whom she spoke , gave her silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their fur@@ y , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised them a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive way of a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she guard against joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- shows : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people submit messages that have been reported negative about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we spoke it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we opted for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , took off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw left me to stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia : you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception rather than the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so in no way I am an exception .
&quot; when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a million dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ c@@ els came into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting with each other , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with just one .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life very much happens so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant tail@@ gate algorithm . to make it fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right , if all look , is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , it receives the dex@@ ter@@ ous ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; once flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by taking a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think out new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , a flying lamp shade wants to become a particularly safe machine . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages depend on the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they ligh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events tempor@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; just 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was born on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized it as a mad genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition capacity enormously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor stub@@ born problems .
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ cked through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when the wave is passed , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly al@@ ber@@ n@@ ous dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and st@@ ow , stretch and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ out when the waves arrived . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be precisely measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; described by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves is as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaks precisely Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks it down . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very fast , you can hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ rendering noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circles around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these are opa@@ que .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , that we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt that we hadn &apos;t expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the no@@ zzles for our arch@@ eological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to take a completely different view of the events in space , the formation of the stars , and ultimately how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang myself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a definite yes , that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , consider life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am on TV . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my television series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so still top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to assemble my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning all around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just sitting around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it &apos;s like I set up troops , as I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as you wear a high tone , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever . &quot;
many people assume that when I declare to them the hum@@ ming that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , that energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive other than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being unable to do anything different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the tot@@ um .
am I just this h@@ um ?
and then the h@@ um stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ driven , burnt out . &quot;
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her m@@ um is a single work title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of one tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my sum was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing bog@@ gling , a titanium does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a flagship titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
&quot; so what do you do , when what you do , the work you love suddenly fa@@ des ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you work , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , being a bank@@ ers , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the hum@@ ming , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and my hum@@ ming is smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and pan@@ i@@ cking , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can do nothing but watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl lets loose in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the tot@@ als , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titan@@ ic surround , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broadcast and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is no force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as ru@@ di@@ mentary as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work rather than being a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I must have problems .
none of them is that I am too relaxed .
&quot; we r@@ attle around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think myself na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think that they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad @-@ mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes by piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
allow yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I will be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the tot@@ um , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum now .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I create , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life in me becomes wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I stir you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; thereby , one im@@ pl@@ uses an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered under severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time , I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I provided patients with skull @-@ bra@@ id trauma .
&quot; it is necessary to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain increases and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and surroundings to make it thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you might even know from the biology lesson that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them in colour to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception point of the same individual . &quot;
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are reim@@ plant@@ ating these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are reim@@ plant@@ ating the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
&quot; the proof they show are these little d@@ ots . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now you see , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that this was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
&quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy in its entirety .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing disposition .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a wrong belief , could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are m@@ apped , our future is glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few realize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to blow up the stock exchanges and apply the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe job@@ less , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , like in an endless loop , strengthens the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . &quot;
in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently causes the circumstances that lead to the killing of O@@ edi@@ pus .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the toil@@ ing poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they admitted to them the right to political co@@ determination with the same bal@@ lot in questions of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the toil@@ ing poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was imposed on politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two took place , gradually decl@@ aring politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power from politics is emig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have so long dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ished , that they star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , the economy , which has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself , is har@@ ming itself by the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the toil@@ ing poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the wa@@ sting of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts go deeper , as it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and take care that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyp@@ er system that lets the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the company is in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines are serving people and people indulge their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; -@@ good Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the business sector : imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those belonging to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but they do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no great gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is trading in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re @-@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we shall awake in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... if we do not , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the Western point of view in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have the appearance of democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , when I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism to democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to acc@@ use China now , to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century itself smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece early this year .
Y@@ V : I guess it &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good @-@ bye to us , and the constant denial that a massive pre@@ dispos@@ ing line was going through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to reject the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to survive by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be postpon@@ ed for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims that he did not make a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; many have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon studios , &quot;
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ hair@@ do and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , it has to find shows that are located at the very right of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the valuation goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows received this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows such as &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after you have watched a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on average exc@@ itation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch anyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives things out for nothing , do you use it right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look at once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them , and from that comes the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve .
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says that this should work with everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work in such a way , it &apos;s a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we are more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way you can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in the regulation of law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ inable lots of data to make serious choices , such as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
first dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision .
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to then take a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of , but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to steer our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will get it out later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much smar@@ ter , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , in spite of the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
