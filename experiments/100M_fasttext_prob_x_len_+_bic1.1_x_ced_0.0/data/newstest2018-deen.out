Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories .
it is annoying when maps are not up to date .
&quot; everybody knows , who had to get upset , because the car Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the Bavarian State Government , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the state government , are anything but current - but precisely because of that very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet which one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the large map of the map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called exposure leaves , were incorporated into cities and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
&quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country , and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; even though the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot;
the manuscript for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos; website .
the comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was made 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; derived from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers in this area , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , where the Oktober@@ fest took place in 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the current paper , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road , one once closed down people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ cy &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , concluded the lun@@ atics of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ te in Haar was 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er prison , young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , East residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ te , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; Main Place , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs seized many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station was carried out . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights group released Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to pay special attention when travelling through the state , since a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; states the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to prosec@@ ute discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately targets minorities , led the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , the people pass through . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
&quot; the group cited benefits such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists are employed 75 percent more often than whit@@ ens in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be willing to bring their deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the crime @-@ crime report program by the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further racial ability . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ bau@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; in the square yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ man &apos;s bacher CD@@ U village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provides insights into his operation , where he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ates in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he called the electric fence project &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
&quot; the grass@@ land provision for a lot of work , a lot of things must be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer even if he did not conduct a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the area could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of EUR 71 million was promoted by the leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained twelve 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ i@@ dens . &quot;
&quot; for Peter Weiss , too , it was clear : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Aid Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state subsidies for pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the prerequisite is the presence of a circul@@ ating bubble recorded by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the area to be fenced may not be tractor @-@ efficient ( incl@@ ination of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ sh@@ edding Project &quot; &quot; in 2018 , the request for eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have ly@@ n@@ ched him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illum@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem to which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is impro@@ per@@ ly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not invite only some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your oppressed masses , longing to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your wealthy shores . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable garbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who sat down to place their words after their death on the base , knew very well that they performed a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by representing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
&quot; Lazarus changed this importance : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives , who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves on . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great story of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever wanted to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oms Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ da@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two ball@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 to start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is something special &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics needs to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they &apos;ve done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Thomas Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ da@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ ti@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path , and last year has set up five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the captain of the team says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows just how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to get on stage . &quot;
what is my talk as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and there will be just such a great atmosphere outside . &quot;
blocking critics about Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he le@@ aked in criticism , for sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to sleep . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skil@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining himself with his voters and play@@ fully de@@ bun@@ ting his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - need@@ lessly and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse advoc@@ ated the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ater @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound . &quot;
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with hatred , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees described as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck on his lead . &quot;
&quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the people used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on homeland soil . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how far it went .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer dead due to passive smoking
fewer people have died of lung cancer in the past two decades because of passive smoking .
&quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;

domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Strasse is in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the agriturismo Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground there is a lot of mountains , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which obstruc@@ ts construction work again and again , is a big problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; the road is closed , and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through . &quot;
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z says . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a hob . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and eng@@ ul@@ fed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with opa@@ que water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a roof@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were assigned no fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that comprised the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ oth and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car with a rental car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which have been transformed into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed to a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ as Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wooden resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port has paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 to almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are being treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 are killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Commission for Human Rights .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; in a report of the 2016 ore dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e , in which reports of atro@@ cities committed in the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture , are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the bolts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Papua , m@@ amma @-@ mo@@ m &#91; women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ the@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter captured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but there is little change in Papua , and today locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ the@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; You said . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai had only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers viol@@ ated their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their ri@@ fle bul@@ lets , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to throw stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; states it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ m was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station simply because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said Commissioner of the Papua police commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded . &quot;
the news about kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the consideration of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; instead &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , indic@@ ted by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; accused of more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody Independent vote in 1999 , said 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ man for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua @-@ Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua , by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ class leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the years , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ il . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills in order to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ic &apos;s election campaign , the restrictions of reporting , were not realised in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s most un@@ troubled provinces of Papua and West @-@ pap@@ a : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right messenger K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; fault &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims carried out a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in one area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus , with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which in just two years is swept through the high @-@ rise , which one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cries of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooling the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis League ( IT@@ F ) has won his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning rates , not spar@@ ingly supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the five set classics , which are often very long , but also very much appreciated , remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missing . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical events , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; it was not until the vote that , after many claims , the proposal had already come to carry out the fin@@ als in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new starting in 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the following year , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. will be facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media events prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a pol@@ l &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent were smu@@ g@@ gled or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally bore il@@ lic@@ it knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent said they had delayed that they had er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents said they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mil@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items which have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it had inter@@ viewed travelers around the country to find out how many mistakenly brought smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who carry smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the security , those who fly most frequently . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids to take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
fluids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
&quot; in doing so , he has so far failed to assume that some of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zzling number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had adverti@@ sed with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation In@@ form . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are submitted , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument is that the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 bookings per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major disrup@@ tions . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if greater delays occur , then the non @-@ binding obligation of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to dela@@ ying the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency turned out to be more responsive than previous administr@@ ations to the needs of the governmental environmental authorities .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for States to meet the 2015 standards for soil @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay compliance with one year , to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment was President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , has long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulation that resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had passed his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be indic@@ ted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our suits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone is produced when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists were che@@ ering on P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests .
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen is invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ len@@ gen their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Standard customer book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the document , there was also a beautiful courtyard beside the former parish church , to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way around . &quot;
there were also people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement @-@ nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from early medieval ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
this was connected with the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two dis@@ member@@ ed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ lows were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the rem@@ nants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; during the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke down the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility from the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the promot@@ ers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery at the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care as ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to be insp@@ ected by wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a mold failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted allowance is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again decided to use the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; this means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning legally . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been dealt with in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; a spokesman explained . &quot;
the circle accepts them for the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed the lease agreements with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is roughly equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen granted the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were easily injured .
the country road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car , accompanied by her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , drove the L 3@@ 33 in direction to Bo@@ gel . &quot;
town and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ fres@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping facilities in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to l@@ ure residents to the city centre for shopping . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offerings the own city holds away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action weekend , are Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; as a result , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well festival , including selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was important to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ ped itself , had told the king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ in@@ gian towns will take part in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote &quot; appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action taking place under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate surroundings with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine were injured , some of them severely injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ gade , on Wednesday ( local time ) , there was a final in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
&quot; an initially missing thing , later , was also recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the accident , the authorities suspected of working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building . &quot;
&quot; after passing through phone calls , Tr@@ ump put pressure on phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall &quot;
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to quit speaking publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president consul@@ ted him because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States were &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt back as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and d@@ umped into the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reflection . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were hoo@@ ked by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , post @-@ employment acts as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
&quot; a court physician sets a sheet on the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI records obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding gra@@ fts were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but none was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer campaign . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election stab@@ bed , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they came away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes with an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are then confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ gel Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ hid , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and p@@ ushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ hid rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Raz@@ an@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in mourning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays , who sings pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; for nearly eight hours , they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd , and suddenly it was over . &quot;
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ord and wipe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ hid hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the post@@ age with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feel the performance left behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what I really do with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ ulate is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will set up a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a giant , six @-@ floor setting . &quot;
&quot; the stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before this , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer par@@ ked , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter posed as rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; pil@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; K@@ ESS , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , seduc@@ es in Hollywood manner a body in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he was frigh@@ tened by Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Eiche ) has to believe in it . &quot;
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly and de@@ pressed the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated with a stor@@ my applause . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; he had to let go of the organ of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto in 2013 , and five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to rejoice .
&quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; Ring &quot; has grown together in a way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive resume .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked at the school already in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; crowd : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
amount : I made Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully cancelled . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
crowd : I gathered some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Youth Wel@@ fare Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , that was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : sure , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
there are always other people in the head that have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also times of negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce more than 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job reduction , which was mainly announced by General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4000 positions . &quot;
&quot; in May , in a third cost reduction programme , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which was sold to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in excess of suicide
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , issued an explanation of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % were in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is balancing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government in recent weeks and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , according to which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smoke @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it show@@ cases the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; stated EPA , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in order to specify where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Columbia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the return of the democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that breathing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and strengthening respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els resol@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take until the area belonging to the church is in the communal ownership , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be made by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council is ho@@ vering in front of such a common space , not just as a meeting place for the residents of the people of the elderly , but also openly in the community . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funding for the current household , will be made through subsidies . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages in order to signal the investor that in this respect , there is no bil@@ lets between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the rise height and makes construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks , is this addition . &quot;
when it helps : it unanim@@ ously passes the board .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings , with which you can &apos;t get ahead so much , but now you lean into the room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger addresses the common room - but absolutely against municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but receive a real counterpart , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter speech . &quot;
&quot; at the request of Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to split the proposed resolutions , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this is how it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we summari@@ ze the decision , we make a giant leap into closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police cleared , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Way from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove up the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic . &quot;
he met a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting car .
FC Bayern Munich must ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game kick against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match for the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the tro@@ phy .
the sta@@ ff@@ ing of the German football record champion Bayern Munich will always be bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; the mou@@ th@@ guard Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added , &quot; The most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights fascin@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the resin , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is the plan of the association &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is contrary to the need for information for many visitors . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase of 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; In@@ quiry come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ enz@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Ticket to Ride will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can learn a lot of interesting things on the star@@ base , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although it lies much further away . &quot;
in which con@@ stellation a select star will be found and when it is best to be seen .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; frequently , from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy are clearly visible with naked eye . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen sponsored by the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the Sun is at least 75 metres away and measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet trail is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
but the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ fe@@ ather@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight @-@ weight @-@ ler &#91; 135 l@@ bs &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their weight @-@ weight title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later pushed openly to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured to tire plat@@ e@@ zer
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the outlet . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then stuck on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour . afterwards , the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , with the result even if there weren &apos;t the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that were two opponents too much , and we have to pay better attention in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and the For@@ tun@@ s don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a free kick .
&quot; for the future , there will be no other than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparations than with the four @-@ chain supply chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t even know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is convinced of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we are in the middle positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ aan and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford to play as many play mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if one cannot speak after a decision of a failed start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; the start to the season I app@@ ended only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have had a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una versus a ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent wherever they are at the moment , &quot; says the Chief of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as an easy favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we have to sweep them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Head of Coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Medic@@ ines Agency ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they are to take a closer look at the age of the asylum after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases which suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older .
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det resear@@ ched the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person openly stated that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier or later . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it for sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is close to 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete block was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the construction is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the first bridge leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is a constra@@ int , which is also used as an operating route . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 metres wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way was to run .
&quot; the special reason is that it is finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented brid@@ ge@@ caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ ing over the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished initially . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the cat@@ er@@ pillar in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridge ten@@ ders is 700 000 Euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; according to the poster . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the deputy federal president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ speakers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the rear - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that is offered .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum One World and one of the organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pipes from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel reported that he was trying for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but got a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there was not enough parking space available . &quot;
&quot; well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at around 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle there are various speakers , among them the Rhine @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners , who wait for the top candidates for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can press back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is there in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and win solo performances in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is how Pet@@ kov sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; ming@@ les with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz Ensemble N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating total artwork . &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer is insured against the Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar magazine : &quot; &quot; I fell in love with everyone I did . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot;
so it has never been conf@@ using or hin@@ dered .
I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she suffered particularly under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in the school age , when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to react in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some consider myself ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate . &quot;
&quot; justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the Party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would hin@@ der us rather than working to make our country grand again .
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lau@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that his country &apos;s exile was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , IA@@ AF agrees to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) evidence of state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e reporting . &quot;
the whole council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realised in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia has yet to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden coaches are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
a funeral p@@ act for soldiers dra@@ gged down in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two killed soldiers who had fallen behind the helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; the Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ explained crash . &quot;
&quot; however , they described the two opposite pilots as the &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began . &quot;
these included H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; roses laid down roses , and the members of the family were arm in arms in the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belonged , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show that the deployment is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance to a country we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and it was said further in the message . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
in 2016 he retired and also called the title &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always fla@@ wed , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk tr@@ umps instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ Tob@@ acco and who had the reputation to be the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wishes swift new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the current Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to take it up .
&quot; the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament will withdraw the trust and elect a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these options must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ ern@@ a &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dissi@@ dent de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land farm .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she returns her land mandate , which she received via the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a foreign language in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the passage of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Socialist and Demo@@ crat leader on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
it supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration in her fru@@ stration , her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
&quot; head of the SPD ( SPD ) in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , repro@@ ached T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with a personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks and answers in the interview with the Editorial Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect against pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; at the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the eggs @-@ bat@@ ches involved . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier isn &apos;t really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food safety is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
&quot; trade has , just like the manufacturers , to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual sugar content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not accessible . &quot;
&quot; un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the present level of knowledge , production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
is it only missing at the staff or in conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food trade ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; by means of the counter@@ f@@ eit means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the Football As@@ sets Eff@@ ect on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring it to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the funding of the team by the power @-@ rich rulers of Qatar .
&quot; clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrawn their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that originally used the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
&quot; during the current 3 @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to refrain from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the total revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambassador is going to be Ambassador and simply to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , try to follow every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced Fre@@ y Board chocolate for the Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation stands before a possible end : the airline sets out the contract anew .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on the request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline plans to contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products are insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current vendor Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged sho@@ ck@@ boards distribute 14 grams per year before landing on passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but even more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
&quot; like many applicants , the Swiss does not want to be betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the greatest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 years , for the 90 years gr@@ unge period ( when the vision@@ aries David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; dividing to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play awesome children , who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting @-@ recognition principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ ist , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy , vi@@ cious plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ins@@ anity that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I think as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , how she will attend the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W , &quot; with its east @-@ west ring @-@ fight icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka tells the story of being a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ire Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de out the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; when Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men , who dev@@ our a lot of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything possible for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials kept large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two persons were arrested in Italy . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
&quot; therefore , the two are presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany . &quot;
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the campaign .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; organised drug @-@ crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail are accused of organised drug crimes . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Con@@ stance has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the studies , Italian citizens were mainly attracted to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , in which several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang . &quot;
Weise conce@@ als large gaps in for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany has serious fla@@ ws . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country of immigration authorities . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ appropri@@ ations &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has existed . &quot;
&quot; in the register , it is estimated that 10 million people with foreign nationality are registered , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the data is administered by some 600 immigration authorities in Germany . &quot;
&quot; because the data were not maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics on people who are not willing to travel , EU citizens are also registered , who do not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such mis@@ concep@@ tions led , however , &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with emig@@ rants , &quot; so it is stated in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this results from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper therefore states that the &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF guide &quot; &quot; such proceedings &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has handed out guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened with un@@ lawful reception conditions and a danger to child &apos;s welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in total , a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ bach had already made available the blood donation service to other people . &quot;
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the community , the community hon@@ ors multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors respect that their blood will provide for strangers , un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; emphasized Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps a number of people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ent parts . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three persons could already benefit from a donation of blood . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn @-@ makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Head of Staff . &quot;
&quot; obviously , a few years ago , the switch to the theatre house led to higher attendance figures . &quot;
&quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a moved to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave up ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after slu@@ gg@@ ish economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulations on an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensified pressure .
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation which was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the cost of credit would possibly have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus that was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households will continue to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scale than expected markets . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year , adjusted down@@ wards , are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast forecast in May . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a interest rate increase , and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , as the tigh@@ tening first is even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; the drop in income , but she added that the wages at the end of her three @-@ year forecast can be &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ uper@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the deposit . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rate rise rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers demanding a 0.5 % increase in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the trans@@ gression in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; wholly &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the Swa@@ p rates , the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and purchase new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis taken prior to intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess move announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p has significantly reduced HIV transmission in risk of infection .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as used on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; when it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , pre@@ p offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Sha@@ de Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that it will help us to step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the presentation .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is subject matter so that when you push the door high , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time to use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that will help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument because of one of the largest real estate agents in Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets is to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a shop on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in De Lu@@ tis - describes about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul , worth $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the bodies proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court hearing took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business , including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul off to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first jeans .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies . Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has held back very much despite being a former AF@@ L member of the board and following a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current argument , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , then he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House he wanted to fix : poor information that was put into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he got a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said former election campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg towards Politi@@ co in February . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping tr@@ ump t@@ witter habits under control , according to six former campaign leaders , is to ensure that his personal consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have contained more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators have managed to keep his anger away from him for a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump Contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons , doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , above all those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone mali@@ ciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter due to har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher also added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , received the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission quite difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sends postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; as the addresses of the searched hard criminals are not known naturally , critics from the population will be hoping and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol will report on Friday from the action that follows the winter season on the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot;
the experience had shown that many refugees were hiding on holiday destinations were called Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ per@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
&quot; 36 of the online respon@@ dents have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s row &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of war that have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of porters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by the dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must be forced to act by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved forward and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more came last evening , probably even more today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks .
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local charge , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the figures have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised warehouse in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police , calling 101 . &quot;
this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambience Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district , the hotel building offered the District Office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been in front of the entrance for a longer period of time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings were broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer points out . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director Michael Kr@@ ause , the sha@@ ver . &quot;
the idea of the city is identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outside systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special En@@ counter sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller shall have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Panel recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first invitations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a longer time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the course of the investigation , several men are expected to act as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at the private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the President might have hin@@ dered justice in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether the indictment is to be prosec@@ uted .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jury is also called &quot; &quot; Prosec@@ ut@@ ors &quot; . &quot; &quot;
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to charge persons for interro@@ gation under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking to him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts reported that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the inaugur@@ ation of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House supports any measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special agent in a fair manner .
&quot; the former FBI chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that not against the president . &quot;
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ all@@ ying , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become lou@@ der and have hin@@ dered justice . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey spoke out in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under enormous pressure on account of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the specialist promot@@ er and his associates . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of the congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft bill on Thursday that the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the nearly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the ice shelf . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron giant who have registered researchers over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear after research data .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual crashes in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scar@@ f file .
Sch@@ el@@ wal@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this shelf , the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete shelf life there .
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scar@@ f file is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate can be under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not raise the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf causes glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project on Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scar@@ f file is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; scientists are argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scar@@ f will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice mis@@ chi@@ cks of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and t@@ ames it to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to bring home ari@@ f to staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U invites to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have inst@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously much sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be found for the places to be distributed this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop &quot; a concept for human resources production and personnel development . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the applicant &apos;s shor@@ tages in a future @-@ oriented manner . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , show specific measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to this end , a high number of employees who leave the service leave the service for illness or age @-@ related reasons . &quot;
so it &apos;s high time to act so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common motion with his party . &quot;
he had long ago caused a big surprise for a big surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and stun@@ ned the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the administrative district with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials as it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the Public Service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy sharpen@@ ing the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the Italian citizenship Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had over@@ seen the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the Docum@@ ent of the Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to hold the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruits . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; for this , three befri@@ ended guides were available . &quot;
the accommodations in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volk@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again there was a look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many meters of altitude have been announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ lets brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group got acquainted with the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga cont@@ ests for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium ra@@ mps in wind and weather ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Ga@@ ins included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons , which are increasingly involved in this field , have also recognized this . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg won the beginning of 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there will be a lot of associations coming up on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified themselves . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen has now consul@@ ted an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that the young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asia . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga team to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup FIFA will be challenged at the competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , they have long established themselves , in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing also talked to the question for a long time .
&quot; for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are traveling internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tour@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to rise to 130 million . &quot;
this is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
&quot; international , many countries are already on the move . &quot;
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the European sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the football first @-@ league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the ancient times , is not enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says de@@ bris . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that everything remains as it was always in football . &quot;
ven@@ om eggs - E@@ gg alternatives for cooking and baking
&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal for pois@@ oned eggs . &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany .
&quot; in the shelves , only eggs are supposed to be taken , which demon@@ stra@@ bly contain no fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot;
Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy is pushing for suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her convic@@ tions behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy in June , which took place on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; horrible circum@@ stance which they deeply regret . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease had a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ y &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is no day when I am not praying for the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding , or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hang up , hop on a building , get up , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder by her British resident in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ t : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m des FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ umps the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not har@@ ming there .
&quot; something else was different on his seat in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ ir right away , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot;
good that could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the character of the coach as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who was born out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation . &quot;
sugar@@ s are best distributed to those who wish to keep a good mood .
&quot; therefore , those who were chosen to compete with the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flow@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on the right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white bond on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ i appeared in this initial formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ invited tro@@ op . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to mark the achievements of the Asia journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le have no negative impact on their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked out quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ver ran alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the nap@@ oli storm frequently occupied itself heavily , but Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game build @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague , Ru@@ dy , admitted that the result was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; play shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as unusual as this Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to some cr@@ un@@ chy testim@@ onies in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting phrase from Sü@@ ver : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller spoke about Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ cuits pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V. enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees the greatest revers@@ al in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes to build a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the right to build . &quot;
&quot; the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Code . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports wan@@ ing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master @-@ Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euros is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates in ten years have become independent after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce , says : &quot;
&quot; until now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be allocated to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , refers to calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than € 20 million in 2017 and 2018 in the preservation of regional roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the supply of power in an I@@ HK survey only with a score 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics at the moment and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement , it cleared the field again . &quot;
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the costs of car manufacturers , installations for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gas ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles , also increase , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sil@@ encing the mighty automobile companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .

&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , there is a raft through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if I go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;

on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ra @-@ saver .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild river . &quot;
&quot; already last summer , the raft across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the no@@ bility of his characters is his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still shows and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things as a sign of greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
&quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans . &quot;
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , rounded Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits at the table today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los random beast in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to affect the movie screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo says . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced verb@@ ose . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change Provence
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to drought @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , the la@@ ven@@ der is declining , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has an impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das transfer , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and much is at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for holiday@@ makers ; it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ sten said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary this year .

&quot; shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ rants or a land camp should be in the city centre these days . &quot;
the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ fe@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and instinc@@ ts are enough . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it only introduced two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings connected every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we desp@@ ise all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions are struggling here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug @-@ kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters liked to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ jek@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , wherever she led . &quot;
he voluntarily admitted he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start @-@ up and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the j@@ est , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control . &quot;
&quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce has been listed on three main stories . &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of former known speaker Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures that were concentrated on the governor &apos;s home town .
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a re@@ porter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that ruled all political levels almost the whole century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a further journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tic by having written down on walk@@ ways and buildings in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killed them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since asked for it to be re @-@ classified by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
&quot; no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as , in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago . &quot;
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly presented the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phones . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of closing , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day , on which Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used clo@@ ak to ev@@ ade its enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; described it as &quot; the best preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cla@@ p . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli , according to the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to carefully cover it . &quot;
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by eating enough din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this cam@@ ou@@ ter@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal for information about his life , including his ser@@ ene content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank to the sea floor on his back . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ c@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you squ@@ int only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that ra@@ ved from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept by western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
&quot; the fossi@@ li@@ zed rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the tus@@ ks still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
fossi@@ li@@ zed rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometre @-@ long jams - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police , around 17@@ .00 hrs between the jun@@ ctions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) under a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries , crashed into each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no indication of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was minor to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the driving direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometer long back@@ stage was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also a massive han@@ di@@ cap on the back@@ track - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire department noted the number plates of the vehicle manufacturers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 PM another accident on the A@@ 8 took place , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
&quot; the conductor comes and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous , or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test mode runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the ticket de@@ valuation without the conductor .
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : you get into the train , call on its ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the case of the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train driver arrives at the ticket control at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger seated there with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train service staff , you simply check in the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Marketing Director . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to poor sen@@ timent in the compartment or large @-@ room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further gn@@ um@@ mers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police had just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly riv@@ eted on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was there to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Ferr@@ ell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone off to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
&quot; there were photographs of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man claiming to be his father &apos;s father who wore a sign saying : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 11@@ pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists in the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; a question came into mind Ferr@@ ell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his involvement brought Ferr@@ ell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for this is how I shall be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the Movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held up by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who beg@@ ged this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was on the front line , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings herself to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers will discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but since the first presentation in 2009 , the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery , &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents insist that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city , of which the rest of the shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction work , it will be the end . &quot;
gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with the opportunity to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; for many years we have been buying almost every week in the market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always very gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , too . &quot;
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but as there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by bigger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will then disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where should the peasant market hall be located during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does the ghost @-@ bit gallery manage to sell all the shops in Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not have a place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the premis@@ e of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown that are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being secretly logged in by the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction has been converted by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette dum@@ b and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future where the president of Chelsea would convert and she could see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing would call for release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and as , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how she comes up with a hands @-@ on phone on hand from the United States Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ inary Inves@@ tig@@ ations like King Kong .
&quot; if they put your word in cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which come together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University due to murder
&quot; a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts of arrest due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by the acts of the County Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ it has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self had now been excluded and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building and that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ release of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; We carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ u@@ ko &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian point of sale r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing inspections in Russia in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being
this divided the groups of companies .
&quot; it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure , which could not be preceded by any health impairment , it was said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs will be delivered to Al@@ di , which were demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine Anti @-@ L@@ utter@@ em@@ itt@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with his customers . &quot;
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ suite executives to circum@@ vent and turn directly to the board of directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can post why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of anno@@ y@@ ances , where those who spoke were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ fin in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; S@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; recently , u@@ ber has been registered as a client . &quot;
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive rep@@ lies in real @-@ time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or is un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously identified and addressed by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster than discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find investors &apos; approval to support both start @-@ ups .
&quot; S@@ apphire received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; at $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , gl@@ itz@@ ers secured their total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only operations . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that hears their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors are reaching returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the management of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointments can be brid@@ ged and employees are de@@ motiv@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on gathering data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow people ask , &quot; Di@@ d you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now conducting monthly workforce surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to better bon@@ dage of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
&quot; it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tained themselves on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot;
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey top parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their audi@@ ts after three hours of exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real pedal @-@ mill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ &apos;s @-@ coach Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the fry postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six playing times in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ unge on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that has already been jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which will be a safety net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire themselves to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video bit of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications from third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fac@@ t@@ ants , which may display results of the fact check from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ ashed mail@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by fac@@ tions out@@ sour@@ ced by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen the wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Per@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ tic Yor@@ k@@ shire , with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swi@@ ie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell smoke , because at that time one fires a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting a little &apos; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted cup@@ ids on the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began writing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last generation , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who had something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ar that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
&quot; maybe the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &quot; The Pri@@ est , &quot; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , who hid the family Dar@@ r@@ ell for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ males rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
&quot; campaign started : covering more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Germany &quot;
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
&quot; at the end of August , it should be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) is not really &quot; , &quot; they write on their website , released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an exclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , they compete with other municipalities in the competition . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a middle five @-@ digit amount and the campaign will cost . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week as well .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presi@@ dency of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ AS in the over@@ population . &quot;
the government dra@@ gs the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the leader of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; religious joint , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ told in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , the major rein@@ for@@ ties of the army and the security forces continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired another 73@@ 95 polic@@ emen , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the European Union &apos;s reform requirements . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is systematically driving an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if that is true , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ gations of the readiness to deploy the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington alters the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees that legal immigrants reduce to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by modi@@ fying the way citizens are issued from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants route for race ski shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the course of the course of the race , it has been fought over and over again - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , you will have to build on the di@@ o@@ des track on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the road@@ way ticket in the long term , construction work on the track will start again this year according to the ministry of transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g trail , the country stands for this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; said Minister Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country receives 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gian Rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by sufficient numbers of people to order it regularly again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the route is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are a big thing right now .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor of Robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of nip@@ ples to type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ per woman would look progres@@ sively .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah goes , troubled one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their growing popularity , they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is perme@@ ated from the fr@@ inge zones , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , can be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap , that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time in which the rights of women in the world are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ g@@ matic to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the cast eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. voters , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we are all going to ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows it , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which it had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely peculiar to the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but I notice in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the force to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as un@@ measurable enhancement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el park in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ ep@@ y and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a curi@@ ously magical experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have judged the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically bur@@ sting while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his hand joints , which he suffered according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosecutor said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; when a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg , &quot;
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ wat@@ chers from caps and har@@ f ho@@ ops were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the secondary school students will go to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eag@@ les to grow up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ under Sch@@ ar introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to turn from him a chicken fell , and the eagle spread out on a high mountain its wings and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen dance . &quot;
h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ckers who wore cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished everyone four @-@ door @-@ collector that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always ski@@ ps with teaching staff , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cu@@ cum@@ ber period is over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only reluct@@ antly abandoned her students because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they could rely on the four @-@ door @-@ voters . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday periods . &quot;
with the children great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ grade students are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulgarian nationals were imprisoned for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally camp@@ ed people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Corporation have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are expected to improve the exhaust emissions of cars from emission categories Euro 5 and some euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action binding ?
no . the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates before will only apply to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit was ordered by the German Federal Aviation Office ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but is not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in the frame . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fit conver@@ ge ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ a . &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lad ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony . &quot;
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said , &quot; This presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot;
59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker has been a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , taking notice of the regular periods of notice , should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administration community as a lower building law authority , the applicant has to present relevant termin@@ ations . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have been collected , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure of the building department and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ planer parking lot have been encountered . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject to change . &quot;
&quot; the latter will book with some 1.5 million euros only , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great scope for a city building master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , many can react quite flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban builder emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the forem@@ an bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( civil engineering ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , should have completed a degree course as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of degree in Architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Building Department is under@@ pinn@@ ed by civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , municipal estate with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as the building rights authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle thrown on lines : South railway track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of Le@@ oben Ost ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
a pink sk@@ ier and a bike rider had been observed near the scene of the crime scene .
&quot; this goes far beyond the bu@@ stle of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put himself in great danger and end@@ anger the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail replacement , even sponsors of the railway customers could be transferred to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum was to be assumed , the spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south track could be carried out without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people had dropped out Friday morning , two of them concerned the long distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not decline , but they delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( Infl@@ ammat@@ ory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and affects 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells that are able to trigger infections are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation it may result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to indicate that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i , which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separately accommod@@ ated , had not had this . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that they did not have a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria inf@@ used the immune system , L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ Season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the bracket role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , it was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only managed to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho for 45 minutes that he had to improve before the start of the premi@@ er league season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made its start XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent disclosed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho once again wished for three other new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , thanks to the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot;
&quot; Boeing &quot; &quot; paints &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner &quot; &quot; in the sky &quot;
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sky@@ line of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such an advertisement .
in this way the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the people from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with increasing terror . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were low@@ ships .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal for the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the presidential elections , the red @-@ green coalition consequently lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ester must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the Editorial Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD elec@@ tor bur@@ sts , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ de@@ an message reaches the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the over@@ stepping of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , was comfor@@ ted by the comrades at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this became worse then - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his town was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communications , it was pretty much wrong after that , which can be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has fought for his political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW f@@ umes and its role in the Supervisory Board , the prime minister of Lower Saxony has already been in the criticism for a long time . &quot;
qualitative survey results were added .
&quot; despite this , or perhaps just because of that , Wei@@ l has always been trying to accentu@@ ate the Con@@ federation in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised themselves from Wei@@ l to stabil@@ ise the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; here , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal force of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
&quot; and Schulz , not at all . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism of T@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ estim@@ ony places her own car@@ eers over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ester has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns to its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , the voters were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments by the CD@@ U Lower Sax@@ ons .
funding for local core III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives informed city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler also gave a review of what has happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been in sensitive rehabilitation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to also promote internal development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Information received from the presi@@ dium of the Government of Karlsruhe that it will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest from the municipality . &quot;
how is a re@@ development area created ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest in general . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders may also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State @-@ State Program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot , carried out . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the stock mapping would be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order will take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate and determine when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective plot , there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the register . &quot;
&quot; once again Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after a sensation and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project . &quot;
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property Fiel@@ ds &quot; , &quot; where it is , among other things , about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing sheet , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arch &quot; is only to be filled out when business premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , restructuring measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; works - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot;
&quot; you cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tour , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Zentrum für II &quot; &quot; were shown to make a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; the present . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one now has both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
white House advertising costs cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that will raise American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military who have been left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork lift truck was exhibited in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message indicates that the helicopter met at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning for the event at 3 p.m. , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second crew was needed for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal government to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked up , &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for political expe@@ dient purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft fle@@ cked against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of reports describing the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to de@@ compose the US president at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was a part of the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in presenting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
unit records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for the re@@ funds rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former president of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump had inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and was jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis League will take place at the stand@@ by third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the stand@@ still third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; in spite of five games still flaw@@ less balance , the Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis League got the sense of reality . &quot;
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports originate from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ring@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as ever . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man does not compete for the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament for the first time in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ gor@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , does not fill someone out of the coaching staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , Congress gave a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; in which he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , which together with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea in North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring the sanctions to life even by the Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; looked at what the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the hit series of Net@@ fli@@ x &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest ar@@ cs of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company , &quot; only with more governmental bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colum@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bites and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1 September .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in own control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last year of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand grew steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the day@@ time K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz explains . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time staff from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen professionals are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the genital ei@@ vers to implement educational concepts . &quot;
for that &apos;s what it is all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison for the city as the most economical . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for some 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; three women candidate for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has released threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat action to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ om said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police information , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to seize the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
the du@@ et escaped without prey .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to check the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glas@@ gow plant by managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company was weighing on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies next to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ di said he invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s head office , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request was to &quot; &quot; express concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers are strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ di said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , continuously check our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the last few years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our mot@@ o@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warning N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La League site likes to regret Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar in pursuing a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to release its release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has made the transfer window heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a source close to the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; but , three years ago , the football world was warned by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ? &quot;
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator intentionally rejected a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , causing damage of more than 200 Euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the local circum@@ navigation of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger met him in his lane so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on passenger cars , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the cycl@@ ist didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the causing vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves the burden of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the burden of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ( &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ) , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared on publication in front of the German press agency , he anticipated by the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ itted Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; double standards &quot; were measured in the reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in respect of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; according to the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bavarian Radio : &quot; you like to go on the church and this is a flash . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows were a very normal pedago@@ gical instrument , &quot; &quot; in order to cope with im@@ pu@@ dent children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the memorial book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is contained in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 dom@@ esti@@ cks sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could also be more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims are aware that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against prot@@ ections in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students stand out for their &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became obvious to the Ö@@ tz@@ er when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all present in it . &quot;
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; one can , at best , repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also sometimes caused out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and throw the key on the ground , but also spur@@ ned ear @-@ cow@@ ards and too nau@@ ghty boys on the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ il time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence in the pre @-@ school , these are certainly tri@@ g@@ gering . &quot;
&quot; one wonders already , whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still eager to work . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of involvement in sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said one of the affected representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the do@@ ers professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that for him ... Bu@@ ben more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , boarding teachers , trusted teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with a very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , George R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up to his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the report &quot; &quot; Weg@@ visor &quot; , &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be repro@@ ached by the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly victi@@ mi@@ zed and wrought , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; as most of the witnesses pointed out , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ it@@ ant : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to George R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
&quot; before the states , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely closed the ears ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the testing sentence continues to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing sentences were already banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they found themselves in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the persons concerned might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where actually the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; one cannot say , however , that he had always looked away . &quot;
that just isn &apos;t true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the beating of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to those times .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; down@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to the present moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right there .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ h@@ or at all times , and not for what was do@@ d@@ ging in the pre @-@ school of hos@@ tility and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s all horrible , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to sla@@ p ear@@ then and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , it has also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image from his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of testing sentence also become a language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all dis@@ miss that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural am@@ bass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys don &apos;t have a big vo@@ cal@@ ist and before every success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , base @-@ good , deeply believing and aff@@ ection@@ ate people , from whom one could not imagine that he could also do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly get in touch with him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgiven him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and dish@@ on@@ est them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , be clear : all you blame it are educational methods that were on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the evil intent , which stands behind it , is all too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the attack would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
