<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a chapel, which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows, who had to get upset, because the car Navi took a green meadow instead of a bypass road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the Bavarian State Government, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely because of that very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large map of the map, more detailed maps, so-called exposure leaves, were incorporated into cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying authorities between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country, and commissioned a topographical survey of Bayerns - of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The manuscript for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek 'website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was made 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbers from the so-called" "original recording" "derived from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers in this area, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, where the Oktoberfest took place in 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the current paper, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" on the Gasteig "or from the hill" On the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeld road, one once closed down people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrency" "Auf der Auer Lüftften" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, concluded the lunatics of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrente in Haar was 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in the area of the former Auer prison, young people now meet at the Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, East residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrente, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombings."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the" Main Place, "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs seized many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station was carried out."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group released Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for the Promotion of Farms issued a warning for coloured people, who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, since a number of questionable, racist-based occurrences occur in the whole state and be noted here," states the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to prosecute discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately targets minorities, led the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, the people pass through."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited benefits such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri Police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office in which it is shown that black motorists are employed 75 percent more often than whitens in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be willing to bring their deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the crime-crime report program by the FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which in the opinion of ACLU will contribute to further racial ability."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidebaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"in the square yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisherman's bacher CDU village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provides insights into his operation, where he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and accommodates in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he called the electric fence project" elementary importance. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland provision for a lot of work, a lot of things must be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer even if he did not conduct a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the area could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface is 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of EUR 71 million was promoted by the leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained twelve 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and maidens."</seg>
<seg id="90">"for Peter Weiss, too, it was clear:" best food is produced here. ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Aid Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state subsidies for pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a circulating bubble recorded by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be fenced may not be tractor-efficient (inclination of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the" "Fischerbacher Weishedding Project" "in 2018, the request for eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of disclosure is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals for drastic immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illumines the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is improperly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not invite only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your idleness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your wealthy shores. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who sat down to place their words after their death on the base, knew very well that they performed a highly political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this importance: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty moves on. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great story of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black looms Scottish members of the Great Britain Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidah Doyle remembers a time when only two ballots belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's Athletics Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 to start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland is something special" "and the United Kingdom's Athletics needs to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Thomas Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidah is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilitih naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"the medium-distance runner Muir leads along this path, and last year has set up five British and two European records."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the captain of the team says that they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to get on stage."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my talk as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and there will be just such a great atmosphere outside."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics about Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he leaked in criticism, for sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining himself with his voters and playfully debunting his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - needlessly and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse advocated the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hater-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hatred, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees described as" "concentrated spam-attack" "would probably call others" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck on his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even then, Washington had anonymous trolls."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people used pseudonyms like" "Juricola", "" "Valerius", "" "Belisarius" "and" "Portius", "wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="451">"we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously."</seg>
<seg id="452">We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously.</seg>
<seg id="453">"nevertheless, the statement of the EPA said that at some point Pruitt will use his" authority to delay and all other legally available powers "to ensure that the provisions" are based on a solid policy and the best available information. "</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlengen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Standard customer book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document according to the document, there was also a beautiful courtyard beside the former parish church, to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way around."</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the village-picture of Tumlingen, the" "Berg" "of the third, the splendid settlement-nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from early medieval ecclesiastical law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was connected with the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two dismembered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were hammered and the bellows were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the ecclesiastical chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke down the steeple and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius facility from the" "Schaffhausen retirees" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the promoters invite the friends and promoters of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery at the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the graveyard."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers put out the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim refuses" "sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim refuses" has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"a few days earlier, the city Viersen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a mold failure."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted allowance is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council has once again decided to use the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "this means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning legally."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letters have been dealt with in the circle of Viersen since last week," "a spokesman explained."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle accepts them for the occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argumentation of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed the lease agreements with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is roughly equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen granted the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Kreis Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three-chain preparations than with the four-chain supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't even know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is convinced of his thing, "" because we are in the middle positions in Kaan Ayaan and Niko Gießelmann player who can build up well, "" said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we don't afford to play as many play mistakes in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about that.</seg>
<seg id="875">"the start to the season I appended only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely due to a storm. "</seg>

<seg id="877">"but they don't know that 100 percent wherever they are at the moment," says the Chief of the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, guests from the Rhineland serve as an easy favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium in Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we have to sweep them away, only because we have the claim to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are stable over the past few months."</seg>

<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.</seg>

<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>

<seg id="993">"the world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, lauded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in sport."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial fair-play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without great losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring it to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the funding of the team by the power-rich rulers of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini according to his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrawn their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that originally used the novel Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current 3-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to refrain from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the total revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG-payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassador is going to be Ambassador and simply to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive, try to follow every attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP."</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG. "</seg>

<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," "said Wenger on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"as soon as a country has an association, everything is possible."</seg>

<seg id="1170">"however, only Swiss manufacturers are in question."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is short.</seg>

<seg id="1232">"according to this, the data is administered by some 600 immigration authorities in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="1237">"such misconceptions led, however," to a distorted debate on how to deal with emigrants, "so it is stated in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they arrived from there."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after sluggish economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculations on an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving for an increase in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalled that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to curb the inflation which was heated by the Brexit and it said that the cost of credit would possibly have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus that was published one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households will continue to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in addition to the interest rates, she repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary to cool inflation and a" greater "scale than expected markets."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"the Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year, adjusted downwards, are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast forecast in May."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of a interest rate increase, and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases, as the tightening first is even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the next few years, monetary policy could not" "prevent" "the drop in income, but she added that the wages at the end of her three-year forecast can be" clearly "recuperated."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"" "the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the deposit."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final ruling on interest rates, the call for interest rate rise rose, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding a 0.5% increase in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the transgression in relation to its target of 2% is "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline of the Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and purchase new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pretext prophylaxis taken prior to intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess move announced on Thursday was greeted by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to enable the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep has significantly reduced HIV transmission in risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt-in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as used on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of mankind's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"when it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people, prep offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shade Health, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV, and that it will help us to step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is subject matter so that when you push the door high, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument because of one of the largest real estate agents in Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets is to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in De Lutis - describes about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"a court file states that this means that Colin has property worth $316 million and Paul, worth $176 million."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the bodies proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the Supreme Court hearing took place."</seg>

<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans.</seg>

<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies. Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company."</seg>

<seg id="1382">"Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, then he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House he wanted to fix: poor information that was put into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television reaches decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he got a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," said former election campaigner Sam Nunberg towards Politico in February. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping trump twitter habits under control, according to six former campaign leaders, is to ensure that his personal consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that trumps tweets would have contained more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators have managed to keep his anger away from him for a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers, the president for strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, above all those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher also added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, received the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise becomes from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building offered the District Office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The town prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadts Mayor Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special promoters Robert Mueller shall have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Panel recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a longer time to have purposefully interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the course of the investigation, several men are expected to act as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at the private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that the special promoter Trump had personally moved into the centre and undertook the accusation whether the President might have hindered justice in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether the indictment is to be prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jury is also called" "Prosecutors". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., also Trump counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team leader Paul Manafort were talking to him."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts reported that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the inauguration of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else about which they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports any measures that hastened the work of the special agent in a fair manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI chief, James Comey, said three times that not against the president."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rallying, accusations against Trump have become louder and have hindered justice."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey spoke out in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under enormous pressure on account of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the specialist promoter and his associates."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of the congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented the draft bill on Thursday that the special promoter could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, weighing over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest iron giant who have registered researchers over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg is unclear after research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual crashes in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a facet background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C scarf file.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelwals swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this shelf, the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shelf life there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that the Larsen-C scarf file is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate can be under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelhos and Eisberg does not raise the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it does after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf causes glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C scarf file is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iceplate is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also affirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists are arguing whether the Larsen-C scarf will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice mischicks of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and tames it to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn't know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is" "competition of public employers". ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"to this end, a high number of employees who leave the service leave the service for illness or age-related reasons."</seg>

<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common motion with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long ago caused a big surprise for a big surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and stunned the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>

<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act."</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpening the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the Italian citizenship Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had overseen the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the Document of the Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to hold the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or obstructions "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruits."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" Berliner outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this, three befriended guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodations in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">Burg- und Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Volkfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again there was a lookout at the lookout point, connected by" "flew" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many meters of altitude have been announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inlets brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers at the open-air inhalation inhaled saline brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga contests for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium ramps in wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gains included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"the first federal liaisons, which are increasingly involved in this field, have also recognized this."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the VfL Wolfsburg won the beginning of 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that there will be a lot of associations coming up on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has now consulted an agency for virtual footballers.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-old, that the young people will also go to the stadium in the future," "says the 52 year old."</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"at E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the FIFA World Cup FIFA will be challenged at the competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, they have long established themselves, in which professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing also talked to the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but Frobbing also sees problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tourneys."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to rise to 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">"international, many countries are already on the move."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the European sports betting company Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot of things are happening in Europe as well.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"according to Dutt, the football first-league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to decay only in nostalgia, and to clarify the ancient times, is not enough today."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her convictions behind bars and five years have been exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was convicted of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy in June, which took place on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-looking eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions brought Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She ended his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no repentance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance which they deeply regret."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental disease had a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is no day when I am not praying for the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother's wedding, or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, hop on a building, get up, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote," You have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is turn on the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder by her British resident in Italy in 2007, before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern trumps the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not harming there.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something else was different on his seat in the cabin, which looked Joshua Kimir right away, even if the extra piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made the rush to his arm."</seg>

<seg id="1695">Good that could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But I could interpret the character of the coach as well.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, who was born out of youth players, debutants and just out of vacation."</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugars are best distributed to those who wish to keep a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"therefore, those who were chosen to compete with the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimi confirmed:" "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flowed over the field as a mini-Lahm."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"on the right rear, that's his position, the white bond on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kimi appeared in this initial formation like the one who can take the rudder at the best."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the uninvited troop."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view for the whole, while many others were busy himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal therefore, to overplay his missing fitness (collapsed barely); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil come out to mark the achievements of the Asia journey (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle have no negative impact on their first appearance in Bavaria-Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked out quite well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süver ran alongside Kimi, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the napoli storm frequently occupied itself heavily, but Süle also tried a few times in the game build-up."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague, Rudy, admitted that the result was not as we hoped for."</seg>

<seg id="1712">"play shift, tempo change:" for this style, I was also picked up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as unusual as this Bayern-world is still for the newcomers, one saw in connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to some crunchy testimonies in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting phrase from Süver:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>

<seg id="1730">"natus sees the greatest reversal in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes to build a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the right to build."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Code."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the costs of car manufacturers, installations for neutralisation of exhaust gas ejected from diesel vehicles, also increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of silencing the mighty automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small ciade, a microbacterial, the dwarf cicadas transfer, and in very dry weather there are very many of it."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And much is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only tempting for holidaymakers; it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chasten said:" instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Rifeodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and instincts are enough."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Rioodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it only introduced two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of killings connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodosice, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we despise all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are struggling here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug-kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rioodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters liked to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Rijekce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever she led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily admitted he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead men... why didn't you say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodolce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Is his love for routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-up and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Rioodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff of Rioodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the jest, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who were the governor themselves as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the edition of this week, Riodolce has been listed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures that were concentrated on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that ruled all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a further journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become phonetic by having written down on walkways and buildings in organized protests" SOS Press. ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killed them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since asked for it to be re-classified by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"no one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly presented the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Rioodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their telephones began to buzz."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with belt rivets and security forces near Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they have published the news on the website of Rioodoce about mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think of closing," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day, on which Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used cloak to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "described it as" the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has amazed researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clap."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeiting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mingle better in its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli, according to the Museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully cover it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that dinosaurs were hunted by eating enough dinosaurs, that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this camouterrier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivorous behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the chalk-time," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal for information about his life, including his serene content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the sea floor on his back."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nocdosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you squint only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raved from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armoured plant-eater was swept by western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the fossilized remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the tusks still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a profit in lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometre-long jams - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first indications of the police, around 17.00 hrs between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) under a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably also lorries, crashed into each other."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there was no indication of the exact number of the injured."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the driving direction of Munich, an approximately ten kilometer long backstage was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as an AZ reporter reports, there was also a massive handicap on the backtrack - by numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire department noted the number plates of the vehicle manufacturers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 PM another accident on the A8 took place, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the conductor comes and arouses an unscrupulous, or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow."</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his seat and thus devaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test mode runs on two tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway speaker. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the ticket devaluation without the conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to purchase it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "Comfort Check-in" "works so: you get into the train, call on its ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"in the case of the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train driver arrives at the ticket control at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger seated there with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train service staff, you simply check in the DB Navigator yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB Marketing Director. "</seg>

<seg id="2012">"those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences."</seg>

<seg id="2019">"how an activist came to learn the answer to the question:" "Streets?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly riveted on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was there to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone off to return to Tweet on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photographs of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be his father's father who wore a sign saying:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman said his rifle and screamed," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists in the view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had" "black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only to know activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into mind Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years following Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, for this is how I shall be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the Movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly struggling on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who begged this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was on the front line, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings herself to a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers will discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but since the first presentation in 2009, the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery," That would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents insist that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city, of which the rest of the shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of construction work, it will be the end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "for many years we have been buying almost every week in the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I don't think it's superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but as there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by bigger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will then disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where should the peasant market hall be located during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost-bit gallery manage to sell all the shops in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg do not have a place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the premise of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown that are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the pts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being secretly logged in by the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction has been converted by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" Suppressed Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future where the president of Chelsea would convert and she could see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning would call for release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the" automatic fragmentation, "whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and as, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she comes up with a hands-on phone on hand from the United States Disciplinary Investigations like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your word in cold, then they have won," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulacles, which come together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that stuck behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistle-blowers allow the C-suite executives to circumvent and turn directly to the board of directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.

<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously identified and addressed by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster than discrimination, harassment or unfair internships."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find investors' approval to support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Sapphire received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"at $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, glitzers secured their total funding to $60 million."</seg>
<seg id="2238">"these investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital."</seg>
<seg id="2239">"there is a growing complex of research, which shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before."</seg>
<seg id="2240">"in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations."</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that hears their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT. "</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors are reaching returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">"when analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the management of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, disappointments can be bridged and employees are demotivating."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on gathering data. "</seg>
<seg id="2250">"because if you don't follow people ask," Did you really hear me? "</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"and if you don't care about it, why should I?"</seg>
<seg id="2253">"Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly workforce surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so rett."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"and after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems."</seg>
<seg id="2255">"at Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run this leads to better bondage of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover."</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said. "</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the fry postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras, six playing times in Westwood carried out practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2272">"I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"UCLA will end their practices as soon as the camp is over, which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class that has already been jettisoned with footballs, which will be a safety net behind a doorpost, will not be an easy task."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"Bruins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora. "</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Perl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaitic Yorkshire, with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says wistfully."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swiiewicz, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell smoke, because at that time one fires a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome-greeting a little ') it seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted cupids on the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the trench."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and began writing. ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last generation, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as" "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" "Oh, throw it on the attic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who had something:" you could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go its way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"maybe the two are connected together?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as" The Priest, "which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, who hid the family Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be a crook, getting debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-males redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise within."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the leader of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"even on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as a" religious joint, "as he gave him the opportunity to" fully clean the armed forces. ""</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 policemen, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they appealed their role as a guardian of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in appeal to the European Union's reform requirements."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing right now.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of nipples to type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that a stepper woman would look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters like" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah goes, troubled one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something Dunkleres and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their growing popularity, they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is permeated from the fringe zones, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, can be very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap, that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time in which the rights of women in the world are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has been pragmatic to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn body and the cast eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>

<seg id="2426">"it has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. voters, also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all going to exert ourselves to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>

<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW-Corporation have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are expected to improve the exhaust emissions of cars from emission categories Euro 5 and some euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are exempt from this.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action binding?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No. the software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates before will only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofit was ordered by the German Federal Aviation Office (Bundesamt (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"the manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation over the next few months, but is not yet known as an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler advised to write every person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, that will be done in the frame."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the retrofit converge?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smeta. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">This depends on the manufacturer's commitment as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, voluntary dealerships do not act on the topic of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">"what do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?"</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"presumably foreign manufacturers would retire, says Smetanin."</seg>

<seg id="2536">"the place is already written - however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a Stadtbaumeister for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes him that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, taking notice of the regular periods of notice, should be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administration community as a lower building law authority, the applicant has to present relevant terminations."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, a number of significant projects have been collected, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is sure of the building department and his staff. "</seg>

<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still subject to change."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will book with some 1.5 million euros only," if we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is great scope for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many can react quite flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what fits in, "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban builder emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the foreman bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is builder," at the end everything runs over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of co-operation: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been doing this for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wants:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"according to the town of Haslach, who would like to inherit Roland Wacker, should have completed a degree course as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of degree in Architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of Leoben Ost (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Investigators go out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">A pink skier and a bike rider had been observed near the scene of the crime scene.</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and affects 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger infections are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to indicate that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan contributes to a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separately accommodated, had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that they did not have a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria infused the immune system, L. reuteri left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2624">"only no fire from the party headquarters, but no headwind from the Confederation, was the most important wish of the campaigners."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, it has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the people from Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching the events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals with increasing terror."</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwind.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were lowships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal for the coalition of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green can simply not be reliable," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Greens Euro MP has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the presidential elections, the red-green coalition consequently lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the backsliding Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Tests to return her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the voter's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tester must immediately return her mandate," "said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Greens to the Editorial Network of Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true," "an SPD elector bursts, when on Friday morning the new hidean message reaches the party centre."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without its own government majority following the overstepping of the green deputies of Elke Tests."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, more not, was comforted by the comrades at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">This became worse then - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stagger, the Düsseldorf-Pleite pushed the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades were laboriously raped in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just exhausted new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next depression.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his nimbus on that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie, while his town was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">"and because in crisis communications, it was pretty much wrong after that, which can be done wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW fumes and its role in the Supervisory Board, the prime minister of Lower Saxony has already been in the criticism for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Qualitative survey results were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"despite this, or perhaps just because of that, Weil has always been trying to accentuate the Confederation in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover, to expand his power in Berlin, did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz's environment."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him because they promised themselves from Weil to stabilise the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"here, Weil finds no fault in the party-internal force of the Lower Saxony Green Party."</seg>
<seg id="2660">"and Schulz, not at all."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"for the time being, comrades try to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed toward the Greens, and here above all on the apostate parliamentarianism of Tests."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Testimony places her own careers over the interests of all others," "says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the Editorial Network of Germany (RND)."</seg>

<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked up," replied the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for political expedient purposes."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refunds rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>

<seg id="2888">"interview:" "Domspatzen report relieves the burden of Pope brother Georg Ratzinger" ""</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves the burden of Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" Wir sind Kirche "(" Wir sind Kirche "), spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared on publication in front of the German press agency, he anticipated by the former Regensburger bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emitted Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that" double standards "were measured in the reporting on violence at the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in respect of the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bavarian Radio:" you like to go on the church and this is a flash. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows were a very normal pedagogical instrument," "in order to cope with impudent children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on misuse cases, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote the memorial book" My Brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is contained in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the Bishum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of assault, 67 domesticks sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be noted that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could also be more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims are aware that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger is relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against protections in the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger's Domkapellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students stand out for their" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as choleric and perfectionist, which became obvious to the Ötzer when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses at the pre-school expropriated outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can, at best, reproach him, learn from it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspar gymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all those surveyed as" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincerely, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also sometimes caused outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knead with chairs and throw the key on the ground, but also spurned ear-cowards and too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frail time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in the pre-school, these are certainly triggering."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders already, whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just plunged on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still eager to work."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also accused of involvement in sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one of the affected representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the doers professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that for him... Buben more intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, boarding teachers, trusted teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with a very clear result:" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, George Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link up to his good name with these disgusting crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "excesses" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"in the report" "Wegvisor", "Georg Ratzinger will be reproached by the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly victimized and wrought, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspar gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"as most of the witnesses pointed out, the subject of" primary school "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspar gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael hesitant: there was discipline, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to George Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"before the states, Georg Ratzinger resolutely closed the ears?"</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," "that in the preschool, the testing sentence continues to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when testing sentences were already banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they found themselves in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons concerned might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where actually the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"one cannot say, however, that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the beating of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to those times.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" downfall of anachronism, "that is, the danger of judging the past according to the present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhor at all times, and not for what was dodging in the pre-school of hostility and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that's all horrible, and I'm glad that it will finally work."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. to slap earthen and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was forbidden, it has also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image from his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing sentence also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all dismiss that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets alone, the rebellious boys don't have a big vocalist and before every success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, base-good, deeply believing and affectionate people, from whom one could not imagine that he could also do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly get in touch with him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and dishonest them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, be clear: all you blame it are educational methods that were on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intent, which stands behind it, is all too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the attack would stop, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
