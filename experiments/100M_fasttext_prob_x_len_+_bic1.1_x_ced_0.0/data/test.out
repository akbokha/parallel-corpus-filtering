J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made this clear in an interview .
&quot; I am always stuck in drawers or stuck on the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; honestly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white glu@@ t she brings the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film is on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a gol@@ fing tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with some colleagues at the beach . &quot;
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and then the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he had his family run over the property of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not s@@ well for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports @-@ aid provided the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; on Saturday , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the performers include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ Stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Com@@ m@@ umps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
more about the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep this in doubt rather small , and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ strain regulations , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in order to invest in it , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost silent . &quot;
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; state @-@ critical tea party .
&quot; thus , there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
Tr@@ ump plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; with its investment programme Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand its renewable energies and demand : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ cal trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , they do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , for instance , for Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
he wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ump , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman arriving here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; many sne@@ ak away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out .
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not shel@@ tered by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and at worst mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about what has been experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr demands . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , if they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , displaced women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stories or own houses in some community establishments only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has spoken about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance Doc@@ tors Stri@@ ke : demands for new work campaign measures
representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to approve new labor disputes in their disputes over a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more competition measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have failed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to have problems , which led to the rejection of the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ AC board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating employment measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors went on strike six times this year , the first overall cases in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the director of the BM@@ A Assistance Hospital Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana returned to the rejection of the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , with the advantage of the contract to be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to do this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be narrow@@ ly fla@@ ky , and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had so beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s eman@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into Russia .
going out was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ attered him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the national TV forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to return . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti wrote it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge about the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian head of state , with certainty , won a bonus for Ankara that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected bodies of the state . &quot;
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change .
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; as an analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize that . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , br@@ anded strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial markers . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that its six Nations sponsor will no longer continue , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the head of the board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit on Pre@@ dile@@ ction at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , who gives him 3,000 profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; on his local race track , he set a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar won , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he clin@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career steps &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few before him reached .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been fond of fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he were not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winning in GB which is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying hard drives for Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the UK flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5 years old .
Russia &apos;s Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivan@@ ov
&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin , unexpectedly , dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest trust in Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who was deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is stated ( in Russian ) that he was later the head of the protocol and Chief Executive Officer of the administration staff . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov has been one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a type of power struggle here ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin that are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to put on compla@@ ining post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin became Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; it was once assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia as a third term of office had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;

crossing Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering work from a truly epic dimension to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a ju@@ g@@ gling for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ proof high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last corner of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern shuttle bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team work , they were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were tos@@ sed off by their fishing boat off Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man in the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a bu@@ o@@ y hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived aboard the boat rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have joy un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a stop@@ over , however , it dis@@ b@@ anded from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ based perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
he then al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds favorable apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be put more strongly in the future in future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next meeting of the Council , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; housing concept . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; according to the SPD leader , Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban surfaces must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the major issue in the town hall is , however , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but to build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still need to be financed , is intended to provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ p@@ tions as possible .
the left desires even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; despite this , Brat@@ mann is making a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compensate for the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , now running bonds should be bought from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing homes back into the bond price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
because in the west town of Fri@@ sten the end of the year will exp@@ ire .
approximately 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price @-@ connection for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , one is removed from the aim of so @-@ called confusion . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , has been lam@@ ented over the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and recently limited to smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once found , they can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which tracks 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people exercising every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; ble@@ w on deaf ears because many public em@@ b@@ assi@@ es are boring and coming from people that look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also cosm@@ opolitan toys that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will fade with time . &quot;
&quot; however , due to poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast created a multi @-@ competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nes on the suspended beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , as she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the sport season last three years , 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ ed from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much going on between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they each won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in the arts gymnas@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted that during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which include her typical tum@@ bling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led easily through two turns , the picture was mur@@ ky . &quot;
suspended beam and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she recovered with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and mounted one on it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final bear - a pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise , she accused the audience of kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the fast @-@ spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder doesn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting leads investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months in nine attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used multiple vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but just like the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself alone .
&quot; of course you have settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a walking aid .
up to his third year Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor craw@@ l and he can still not speak .
but he is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund thought for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life associated with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice to mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it &apos;s getting better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flood their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely achieve record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream in@@ undation in the Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mo@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 9@@ am , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step @-@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him . &quot;
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the age of 48 , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities , and he was the only one who could swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents out of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches that were now flooded .
the rec@@ tor of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by floods .
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa has been closed almost two dozen roads due to the flood , and sand@@ bags provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been flooded , but no reported on Friday until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shooting injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he went through a lot , his small body was g@@ lowing out of balls , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ in@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ caster that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police had just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , out@@ stretched the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were bus@@ h@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; said police man Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the Police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by an ag@@ grav@@ ator on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I put forward under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I &apos;ve been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ines , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ nexin routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ competition event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so do sports classes throughout the country do not look out . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same track as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily comes up in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
the majority of these sports clubs are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to thank the municipalities au@@ n innum@@ erable young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy accessible exercise . &quot;
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality young people who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , that you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the Con@@ tract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend contributions to improve the maintenance of the hours . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have continued serious concerns on the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat the current Occup@@ ancy Cris@@ is and agree to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes with discussions insti@@ gated by the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; that happened when Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the vibrations and address the concerns of the assistance doctors .
&quot; if he fails to do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further training measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ statement for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything of only a little , but they already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and only worry , need and inter@@ ruption for the patients , car@@ ers and their families . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive engagement on other important topics - such as disp@@ at@@ ching , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training period , training breaks , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls forming the plaque .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year for the release of a government report on corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
&quot; former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ les verb@@ ally interfer@@ es with the police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; sensi@@ tivities concerning ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of election bo@@ oths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er simply must call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply not removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they give up their vote to prevent someone to vote twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election scandal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court ruled that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic conditions .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the consequence of an im@@ itation in which one person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the che@@ ating letter of letters - when older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding le@@ aps to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ an backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions had unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; exagger@@ ations concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider choosing to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists work on complete let@@ ter@@ heads and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ heads .
the police force the authority to set up barriers for election stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ating an accus@@ ation based on the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters are alone in the election cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ let .
&quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ in checks &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The Jud@@ g@@ ust in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger for Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have advised the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of border and band , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ tenor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athlete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you are allowed to believe in the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; hunter and wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ go@@ yle on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of Di@@ dy@@ mus could be from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
team member of the US squ@@ ad in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take center stage this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ tenor for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh was compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others have noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons consisted of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers have died as a pig .

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ater was &quot; as low as &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ ffel .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; excit@@ edly , as he called M@@ ief , he died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming trun@@ ks 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
spectators across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ater from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that she was still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming trun@@ ffle for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many people asked him &quot;
Twitter users did not return when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s look like ra@@ cists . #
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment was broadcast on a swimming power . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who answered Twitter about Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed very much yesterday night to our viewers on broadcast and our fo@@ undry in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the flo@@ ater and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us turn , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the flo@@ ater and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was no dis@@ regard intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to taste under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , drew it out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anybody , or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ ant to think that someone would take shelter with a person who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes off the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of pants and find out that another woman touched her and went out and did not wash her .
&quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been sold out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your ban@@ ker around . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn yourself first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the gun line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the aggres@@ sor jumps up from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before they move backwards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , the saf@@ est thing is to hand over your money - if you &apos;re not a child of Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler underwent a serious examination by laying down some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k paid his course on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before laying each object , he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get in . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the idea to lick the flush button of a train toilet , which has been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; luckily , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Lord W@@ right was known for testing the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines , traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ings at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task turned their immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said , &quot; As a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just able to do justice to his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his prob@@ ation scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands were of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; validation Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they at least use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria included . &quot;
&quot; social family destroyed before del@@ o@@ ging social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ port@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls exhibited g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared against the walls . &quot;
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also known .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ ded her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
one of them said : &quot; they didn &apos;t bother anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gy is always the final step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into account . &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extreme and their deeds for their neighbors had to be aw@@ ful .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage moun@@ ds that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial law .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti covered .
the police say that they are les@@ bians who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ ac@@ ent military jet flies on the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aer@@ op@@ lane of air forces placed an incredible dive
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no security risk was present &quot;
this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ul@@ ent jet crashes on a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle movements , without first seeing what came through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro ling@@ ered in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , so that it was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet was a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility conditions , but the forces of the air insisted that the safety was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which four people on the island Madeira came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly deep into the air due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts its visibility &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first time in the new season for the first time on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup east@@ ward against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash desc@@ ends three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ th@@ inner has to do without the under@@ lie cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europe @-@ League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in the leg during the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen comp@@ eted for the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique , in this regard , refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Brazil in the League , but with T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining candidates . &quot;
&quot; before the first obligatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team at the Spanish Master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince even at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ cu@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate League for Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup winner achieved the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title to each other .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would take the single title in the character of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches . &quot;
they pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to this place , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I am playing for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang concluded . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was unexpected un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang down as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot;
but nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ z@@ zu@@ ani won the Bronze medal for 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing suffered a rib@@ bing injury after that , was afterwards in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , had become Olympic @-@ fourth in a similarly high table tennis tournament . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump has dre@@ amt of &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump has now given the weakness of his campaign in the present repub@@ lican strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ assured Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire mentioned such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts start to grow in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; Tr@@ ump told Evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty of false reports on his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group . &quot;
repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds are w@@ ob@@ bling
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equally imp@@ acted by the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the gap commonly used for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; or I will make a very very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to withdraw funds to support its election campaign , it should not present any better survey data . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans may attack the Congress more strongly for the Congress . &quot;
Olympics : three @-@ month fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro storm Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after an attempt to commit suicide in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer at home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee told us to set up a committee of discipline as soon as possible in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former S@@ printer and present @-@ day coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to the team management of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has investigated the IO@@ C for information about the case , in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate the assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i became World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation headed by Michael Rot@@ i was stri@@ pped off by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; after numerous D@@ oping processes , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IO@@ C . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose D@@ oping control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been raised that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it has been proven that this sport has been dop@@ ed and dop@@ ed systematically . &quot;
Russian athletes were therefore excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and fulfilled itself with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli &apos;s compli@@ ment goes back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the West Side Story is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London @-@ based school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the attorney Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family , a few weeks ago , learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London went to a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton is going to stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority guide in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson on Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton , if he would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID told that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked men , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nu@@ dity magazin of Old@@ school Play@@ boys stands out as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
it seems that he is doing the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; those who don &apos;t listen and Erdo@@ gan is lying on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers to escape from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; following the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already crossed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity some months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the persecuted coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were still fighting . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association called for the German government to be &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
in the last few months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fire marking as a Gü@@ len trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other academ@@ ics professional existence .
&quot; those who do not listen and Erdo@@ gan will be seated on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sa@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all applicants entitled to obtain asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are no fighting against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; until 2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than now it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and agricultural elections - that bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , volunteers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of the vote , can only be lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to pass an election campaign almost over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in the poll@@ s . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tions .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the countryside , distributing roses and talking a little bit with the people , just as he did his legendary , elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , soul ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the thri@@ ll of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like doing election campaign at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale events ; Merkel &apos;s federal government is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the North East CD@@ U wai@@ ves largely on the usual election results on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you crum@@ ble the base on the land that it has to ex@@ ert itself very hard to find a wire to the people .
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly there is in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; but the advice of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ o to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village parties , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats recently concluded by 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 2011 election , the SPD ( SPD ) had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 per cent ahead of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of vac@@ ations and mostly lay their campaign on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral campaig@@ ners go on search for local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : inn@@ s suffer under block
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; also praised is the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up residence journeys . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now depart from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; in part , there were considerable complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Princip@@ al Manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping tracks were looking for and rather than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
&quot; since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself spot on the spot . &quot;
two to three times a minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; however , since the construction site has continued , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for business people at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 san@@ itation has led to sales collap@@ ses , everyone who asks is scrut@@ ini@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are , therefore , produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
the sales revenue is based on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street renovation took its place &quot; two years ago . &quot;
he has to dis@@ miss half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , replied that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
he can understand that other regular guests are less frequent passing by because of the complicated traffic management .
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else nice . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family climate is coming back after the renovation works .
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is brutal .
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed down . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ver@@ ress .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not over@@ call anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; as Minister of the Interior , however , he was on results and at a &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time to complete his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some are already known , announced , announced , that a new security agency is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security officials is not surprising .
&quot; in part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère ki@@ cks off a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD until now : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck out jihadi@@ sts with double nationality . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that the coalition partner already has no chances . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in themselves : he plans quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are picked up in the country should have their smartphones checked before and social media accounts are to be exposed to a security check .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before , such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some things have an even negative effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - for example - in the im@@ balance of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère says that it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; and things that people were deeply busy , could not be cl@@ ung out in election campaign hours . &quot;
the inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
&quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
&quot; with regard to internal security , Union and SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties , it was high . &quot;
&quot; only a dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy @-@ collecting collection of some Uni@@ ons Home Secretary , in which the department leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
&quot; here , too , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds . &quot;
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ vo@@ ke you .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first be shown . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; the SPD , too , is currently trying to get out of the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ al@@ ises his readiness to talk and says , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going to get worse .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the number of deliveries increases worldwide . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t work in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen ki@@ cks off in the second half of the year when the deliveries are delivered .
&quot; despite its many brands and some good @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can also advance a plus in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW nuclear brand slow@@ ed particularly in Western Europe and thereby reli@@ ed its sales as a whole , as the company noted in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , posted sales of 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries dropped by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of marketing sales , led the weaker figures from July mainly due to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um had also bur@@ dened the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ atmosphere first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly imp@@ acted domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still worse by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler continued his sales growth from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone some 2.5 million cars are calling for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer stipul@@ ates a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in business travel . &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot;
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW &apos;s representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry , and the KBA in its entirety . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion , no deterioration will take place and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , in future , demands targeted interest rates from rich spar@@ rows - as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German B@@ anks Association speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers do not have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee covers the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 on sight deposit or daily deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will in future cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost , &quot; said the Chief of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , he now pays the costs further . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the counters of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four crashes , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers have an understanding and exchange of other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co @-@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to carry you alone , whether it is economically viable . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ wer@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , but the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they keep money for free . &quot;
&quot; established in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , sports@@ men and business@@ men live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the Co @-@ operative Association of Bavaria , which calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle @-@ aged love records .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section to re@@ ap it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ elic male middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght at age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely pair of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stopped , keeping my hands and something whis@@ per like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slow in its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where independent sal@@ es@@ men once lived - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow it home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a si@@ ze@@ able number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early se@@ ers who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people have usually emp@@ tied their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a store such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took an impulse to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that call happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with me as a collector , and I think that it is so with many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to mentally get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a stack of plates . &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten out of a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musical . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who are slowly getting pur@@ er . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts offers the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it makes more of a window @-@ shopping experience than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collection of disks is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression of mus@@ hing jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates by Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they are not taken into account at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
&quot; they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bee on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men across the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demo@@ lition of businesses in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely trace@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the demo@@ lition was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café alive .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closing of &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the Jung@@ ung Bank increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin stays comb@@ ative
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic season , Tony Martin will not be missed . &quot;
&quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyse calm@@ ly what grounds would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything that we have changed lately .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
&quot; Be@@ am went on with his offer only in January , and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give players up missions and counter@@ pose enemies and provide equipment . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested which should lead to a particularly effective over@@ haul . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at the event of accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary pace , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ itz for keeping speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days for un@@ interrupted measurement operation , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all vehicles can be detected at the same time using laser measurement technology . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access prohibited by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved by car with a trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also fire@@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in different federal states according to Vit@@ ronic and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class catches gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
&quot; Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back@@ rest , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Gold Med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the boys , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independently of this , Fi@@ ji could have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but probably it won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game in Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began to surprise the attacks G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in running bus@@ ses . the World Series Win@@ ner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au standing in the corner . &quot;
&quot; four minutes later , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a stock@@ pile of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the re@@ match , and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings from the GB team and ran to the line to make a goal .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning about it . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted basic changes in the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ sts , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and G@@ TC was cr@@ ushing beaten in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown drove the bu@@ cks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer Cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal@@ ised gold than in these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 severe P@@ ieve that entered history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an added importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; there were three voices in the boat even if there were only the two of them sitting at the helm . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that set such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 3 un@@ written application , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers , who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was nobody hit@@ less than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked something . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes slightly the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky to be treated at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the proper term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts on Williams , who had a nerve @-@ riding morning spent a little more than usual , and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en cried , &quot; Sta@@ y in the process , remain in the process . &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding with her own Steve Back@@ ground TV adventure .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish pot@@ able water @-@ purpose con@@ federation as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government acknowledged the con@@ voy .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group applied &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband workforce , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the Dr@@ inking Water Pur@@ pose Association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and wil@@ ler with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the For@@ ced Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and reimbur@@ sement of farmers , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always included innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District . &quot;
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller commen@@ ced Mr. Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were , however , the rup@@ ture on the high tank near church lou@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has progres@@ sed well and is now working in New York privately , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting for life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 a.@@ m and killed them deadly .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him , he was publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
&quot; it is , however , a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man we@@ ars bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the cause or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing @-@ off@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more at present , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ depl@@ eted and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition in the existing systems for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; at first , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required . &quot;
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts have been particularly important for the steel industry .
&quot; in view of our &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading business climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann explained in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the situation further exac@@ erb@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations in price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to avoid conclu@@ ding individual works . &quot;
&quot; around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in orders . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mming study she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior league . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and to organise , to be able to leave and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , singing had a much higher significance ; it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people stir@@ s many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers de@@ compose for long rec@@ umbent events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrating on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone do so , not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do something for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a tone goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone is singing from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with Internet research . &quot;

cats react more sensi@@ tively than males on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the sleep of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to lau@@ ts of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; tom@@ cats react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the author of the study , which was published on Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already fi@@ gured out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens would differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed in the M@@ H@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
&quot; they were presented to you for a call of little ones , taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cries , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned to the loud@@ speakers faster if this calls off the very excited kit@@ ten .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is again taking place an important football game . &quot;
&quot; prior to the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even in the case of sus@@ pending the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
football doesn &apos;t stop even before football .
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ g , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South Bank that is now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this does not affect the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan declared on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; however , what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; there will be a special arrival on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; in the Europa League will leave early . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it only reached rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ret King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; after the coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , under contract and in possession of Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had announced after the coup attempt to not return to the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to do without a third of his annual salary estimated to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made it clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als opportunities at Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about this - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a D@@ oping @-@ lock had put her start right before the games , was stun@@ n@@ ingly clever at her start ( 100 meters chest ) and lined up mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile she was still standing in the hall , provo@@ king her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it became clear that she would not get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are a lot of other sports@@ men , who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than ever , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m relay race / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit for six months after taking the pain with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the oral in@@ takes and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positively and locked 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world to date . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it was established with him testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title for testosterone abuse in 2006 . &quot;
the also recognized bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games was due to a verdict of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record scientist and gold favourite was tested positive only in May , but can still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and expi@@ red on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austria injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it . &quot;
they planned their journey home at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ump@@ hal@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard .
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life @-@ life district . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coast police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ ump@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks did not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact date and location . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed its officials across the country to reinforce the safety of important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bomb attacks , but most of the time they are not against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thai king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the suspi@@ cious explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits to the military great influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody civil stri@@ fe , continued to support the Kingdom for stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine had killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; has become the target of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; according to several state offices , the constitutional guar@@ dians of the Federal Government have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Chancellor Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional guar@@ dians in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely att@@ un@@ ed to the authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the boss . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a pra@@ y@@ er@@ ful advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not know what to do . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal convic@@ tions and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many transgres@@ sions went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of asylum seekers have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Linke , which , however , have become radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympic Games or World Records will determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently turned into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 runners . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to popul@@ ate swimming in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , have just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; some media referred it as &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired on f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - the owner of a shop at the New Place has been ordered .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their shop on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the lo@@ oming election defeat not so narrow
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; if with election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already considered an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , he wouldn &apos;t mind : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats &quot; s candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; in his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post In@@ cre@@ ases In Trading With Elec@@ tro @-@ Transpor@@ ters
an electric @-@ delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously big .
the mail is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oters as well .
&quot; in brief , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post office will also offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether to sell its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ chairman Jürgen Ger@@ des had said , there are always post @-@ questions , such as tra@@ des@@ men . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ manufacturing facility , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and tier . &quot;
Ger@@ da had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and put a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K leadership decl@@ ines after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the retreat came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann to be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after more dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management is the world &apos;s number five in front of a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahler , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as early as 1 September , the management board member of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ ck@@ inger , will take over the company . &quot;
he should officially take over the function of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation .
&quot; on Friday , a spokesman for the company did not want to mention details . &quot;
&quot; those who will conduct the market research company in future , are still unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment about the continuing success of the restructuring initiated several years ago was large . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been the industry leader since 2011 .
&quot; the fruit of restructuring , however , is not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the latest bad G@@ RP business figures , every investor becomes rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the first half of the year , sales of 72@@ 2.0 million Euro shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , profit in the second quarter primarily imp@@ acted the decline in the value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the company &apos;s impairment of € 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , was a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line of the line . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hear@@ n in tren@@ ches : eight injured people
eight people were injured in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hear@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries and told the police .
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which partly drove on the return line . &quot;
the bus left the road to the right and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire department liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oud district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; starting on October 1st , 2016 , the fees for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ proven@@ der 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage treatment will increase at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover for these sewage works . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from world food , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the budget . &quot;
the increase in fees amounts to between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt stated that a new calculation of the fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period can also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained the serious increase in fees for all three sewage systems with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , during the rec@@ lam@@ ation period of all three plants , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses in all three plants fell to a considerable extent , not least due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the th@@ igh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt stated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the waste water system Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage ponds had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued care and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully penet@@ rated .
&quot; in addition , Schmidt explained that the market community has been spar@@ ed from large entertainment costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run by the view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater @-@ purpose association could not be extended because of its lack of public facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when Posi@@ tive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % compared to June 2016 , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices stayed as in advance with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect denoun@@ ced as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ flo@@ wered , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies a day . &quot;
all false cuts arrive at the public .
&quot; snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused , that the App Black@@ face would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter that gave them s@@ ling eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; &quot; inf@@ ring@@ ing and ring@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pushed into the absor@@ bing extrem@@ um . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial controversy will reflect a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that made Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a staff member who focused on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; IS@@ IS Military Intelligence Def@@ ects IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; United States Central Command , military personnel of the United States Central Command , changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican Party Committee members , intelligence committees and military budget com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically de@@ filed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , reported a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com extend to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it did to the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com descend@@ ant publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts wor@@ rying about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; &quot; Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; har@@ med mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; gave dispro@@ portion@@ ately little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
but Mr Schiff and the democr@@ ats stated that no evidence of a White House intervention could be found at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor , who after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts commen@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations also have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush proposed only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker declared that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al@@ ous command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the U.S. winning fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after firing three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising peg through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the past London games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things into a better one . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely plu@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ pack from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball across the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events are constantly and ines@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the cross@@ bow guard to the swi@@ mmer to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s talk in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the Contro@@ versy between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there &apos;s Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast , or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partially in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized : guns shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign long .
&quot; but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely noticed that many of those I had inter@@ viewed didn &apos;t know that it is actually a Olympic portal . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes competing , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , pi@@ ke and balances ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are evaluated according to the design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ons hoping to go further in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the top and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in tel@@ ev@@ ised broad@@ casts a further mo@@ cking goal : the world or the Olympic record . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam out the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympic man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ ding , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that nin@@ ety prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shot .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid West ally with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the government to supp@@ ress - the opposition in the country has been limited , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you want to supp@@ ress people and have no other options unless you protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions escal@@ ate along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ liber@@ ating Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , who were forced out more or less in the last few years , could use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of before being t@@ ink@@ t@@ ine under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services have improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians saw that they were assembled in such a way as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Christian high@@ lands , have prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and domin@@ ating the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tactical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and to render them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of people prot@@ ested against elections , which , according to analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest walked relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ deeds of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position .
&quot; the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to break down in an already volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement that Obama was founded by IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings out his co @-@ workers , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , to declare statements which he could not even mean . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump went back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was totally serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate wanted to know nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism en@@ capsul@@ ates Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ enting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack out Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics , and then return it as needed . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ using the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more et@@ ched note as his survey data has gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing his attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent hands @-@ on advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true , in this sense , that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organization , he called it Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ ker , totally wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once crowded at the market price , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; verb Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop selling Ver@@ b in summer 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native ste@@ eds it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ review wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time staff of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered him a customer to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ dings such as cap@@ ers and sour onions . &quot;
there are natural cycles .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the club had closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and on the culture that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the club in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to a quarter to seven , every day like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not win a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to leave them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed cup of coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb suff@@ ices to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; Co@@ das last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bri@@ ck@@ laying in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ ed , this was fitting the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women boiled for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the roads with which the country turned into being no longer the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; , &quot; because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , because a low @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction took preced@@ ence over flavor or even healthy kitchen understanding . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , you prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , drove the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ fold man from the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost golden dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the c@@ itation of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the ways of the Great Depression era to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to its legs .
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; She really made people sick . &quot;
there was the case of the wind .
&quot; after the dishes were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew out a dessert that they prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt took for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a modest name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each turned a little reluct@@ antly to a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E folded three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack on the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civil protection groups who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers use their own lives to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a lumin@@ ous symbolic character in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
one woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quoted his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ arks usually come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks receive offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is lei@@ surely swimming along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland would become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
&quot; their time @-@ ser@@ pent@@ ine measured them , when they furnished six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , prey made this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ tures from higher water layers down . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks who catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remarkably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ ls .
&quot; their birth , therefore , was to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons research dra@@ gged large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l , on the other hand , had a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempts , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland @-@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in its l@@ enti@@ l @-@ core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter long grass shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication became apparent at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no accident that such meth@@ us@@ als live mainly in icy waters .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal shed heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; thus a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on issues relating to construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee accepted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying made possible , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ ens@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau are able to appeal to young families and senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , bau@@ bles can now register in the town hall from now on , and the public council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also make inquiries for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to rev@@ ise the land use plan created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ timely lar@@ n , the industrial area designated there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the City of the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W competence field and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial establishments are allowed to continue operating from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the United Kingdom . &quot;
they are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such is the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority ( E@@ IO@@ PA ) and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg owns a big fund industry , but as well as Dublin is deterior@@ ating in infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer business consultancy , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , the econom@@ ists believe . &quot;
&quot; according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry worked in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba . in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ st C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. officials , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to reduce costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were su@@ iting each other and took ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ y@@ vir , active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they have once again taken full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; supported by the United States , the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j was rec@@ ap@@ tured near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a group spokesman said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ing the city , following the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS , the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday his tax return for 2015 , which resulted in US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ ors ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , publishes his tax declarations over the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton announced his campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Spezial@@ advisor , spoke to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax tests have not been completed . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ling@@ ing critics , among other things the Repub@@ lican candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal issues with regard to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business owners and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , called Tr@@ ump to meet their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return by 2007 .
&quot; the clinics currently living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of ca . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of Clinton &apos;s 2015 clinics showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works body promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its funding along with the U.S. nature conservation by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the world @-@ phone number dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom is bur@@ sting with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air . &quot;
a touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is an attack@@ er who shoots a piece of gold in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media tur@@ mo@@ il after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests were &quot; &quot; requested &quot; &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; released his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country code list .
&quot; the country , however , was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident spark@@ ed quite a lot of resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given up the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; she said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel promptly denied all accus@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added now .
police op@@ poses tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sa@@ o Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants watched Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the lifting of sanctions rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , between Moscow and Teher@@ an in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the part of Russian enterprises on businesses grew strongly in the country , shared the ambassador with them . &quot;
Russian companies rely on existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trading sum between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , Russia &apos;s foreign representation amounted to about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador is hoping it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses for : beverage market inv@@ aded in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the Be@@ we XXL Be@@ verage market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun @-@ gun , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , from the employee of the drink market , demanded the publication of cash and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
nail old : play and fun during summer vac@@ ancy
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet , recreational area of hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to save with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s management in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days the group of the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ egi@@ vers were indul@@ ged in culinary delights with their homemade food such as Sau@@ ren Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were created to create beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed at home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the Gates of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ tag@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage trip from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the course of two years , the round of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage tour . &quot;
&quot; different pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were tested and finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and hal@@ lowed rooms went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s path from Münster began . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a break to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish church of the local parish was at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; at the stage goals , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller gave a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ te@@ bach .
&quot; the day after that came the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first some 500 metres altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metrop@@ ole metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner is stor@@ my home , when Brit@@ on won Gold for Rad@@ sport &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embark@@ ed on the anch@@ or@@ age , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the World Cup Championships in London , despite the Ho@@ ys withdrawal . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was Jamie Staff &apos;s replacement .
they did this in good time as hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - who prevailed with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ points the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he was tight , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove round in a higher gear , to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked down from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; Glas@@ gow &apos;s 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic champion and beat the World Champion . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a weak start . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a phenom@@ enal victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ speed race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday he had disputed himself with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team is relying on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama took place in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton played in April in the midst of sex and mos@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land based on the abolition of energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby raises all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt consumption accounts for around 10 percent of the entire production of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and risks closing .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p have smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the sm@@ el@@ ting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force since November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual shut@@ down amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is yet another explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn against the possible closure of the melting furnace in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 900 MW each year with around 900 MW of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both systems should disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , sc@@ ary reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z On@@ kel and Produc@@ er of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d act of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to have beaten her Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover celeb@@ ri@@ ties is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been reviewed before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mod@@ eled &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 and one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; but even with the small probability that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even though everything is applicable to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t appeal to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these feelings were high again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the wrong side , the point seems to pass by . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres annually reject 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s hot@@ test centres are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ sions and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already operating at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell , director of the Municip@@ ality Council of James Far@@ r@@ ell , said that the last survey of the National Association of Public Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services , which you need , are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the German government will shor@@ ten the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly remove these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action once you have been told that in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on one employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i agreed to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally , before realizing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the head of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired in order to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and arms @-@ lovers - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and appoint judges . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that the media had torn his words from the context , and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot;
ordin@@ is complaint requests damages from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and by Philip because of bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; hope Hi@@ cks , press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks , was not able to reach a position . &quot;
try to contact Philip equally failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; not responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot;
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s in front of state elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to confront the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD ( SPD ) fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally short of the CD@@ U , which could come to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 per cent in the Parliament &apos;s parliament .
&quot; according to the survey , according to the survey , the SPD &apos;s vote in Berlin was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were still behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left at 15 percent ( 11.@@ 7 percent in the previous year ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
&quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
meanwhile an iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; came to the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover , Germany as the &quot; Office in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ Format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that standard : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser when tor@@ menting slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was finally sold and handled to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; the market today is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always online , this is day for a lot of people every day . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march started , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
Sa@@ gen now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity , not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as we did in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , to create £ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most busy walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus - Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , are trying to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it reported that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ register ads on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the coding on its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the indication of what part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams , spokesman for Ad@@ block Ben Williams , wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been underway between the line @-@ cur@@ sing open source community and the users since the invention of display loos@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lamps have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company refra@@ ined from using ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokesman distributed . &quot;
&quot; desktop PCs offer a large share of revenues , so Facebook makes the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences tool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ min &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would block contents on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; a Facebook spokesman told us in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focused on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
driving a woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
&quot; the police are calling for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday exceeded the presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident happened on the A1 motorway close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark in an act of despair , &quot; hit the streets and were hit by several cars , &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill herself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , said the police , who urge them , as well as every witness of the incident , to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter told the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian prec@@ e@@ des in the middle of the night on the highway as it was stated in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after killing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- responding to an emergency call -- responded to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabit@@ ated according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere , could have had similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus increases its day@@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was once believed to inhab@@ it , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans were evapor@@ ating and her water vap@@ our was burnt away by the ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere was left to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos;s coach
Patrick Roy re@@ joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
during the summer I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired him on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League . &quot;
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the season in any of the two last years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand during the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference 5 points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal editors and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles concerning wages for North @-@ West oil workers are exposed , while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of stri@@ pping the current dispute , &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions in the next weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes ever taking place in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data assi@@ sts astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen rotate to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are related to the formation of planets . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these stra@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler signals the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star fle@@ cks -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers while bigger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much to find out about what we would like to know more about how , When and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star res@@ ig@@ ns
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; following his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; &quot; announced the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , has been awarded $ 27 million annually since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez has paid for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es has managed several mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the Ruh@@ mes@@ halle of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside of the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for many years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the block was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes an attempt to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , got married to the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ ies of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival , Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a wis@@ est athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters steep@@ le chase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically sur@@ vey@@ ed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Criminal Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the events over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing has been requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; says X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will co @-@ operate with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova was over , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should already have been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly announced his criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation should not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg has been tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon just three days before Tom@@ as@@ z &apos;s brother Tom@@ as@@ z . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming , the previous off@@ ences in China had also taken care of the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ tled li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was tested positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in the Chinese championships , but only had to sit down for a three month lock . &quot;
tags : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware effectively attack companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partially repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be rede@@ emed is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently observing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the software programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place rapidly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working on a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users find their personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is closed . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is hit . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies affected sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely break their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure resear@@ ched the areas of use and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat on how to pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private persons are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more prob@@ able that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware kits were created by buying the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of supply includes a matching tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for additional hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set by a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is per infected host .
&quot; the criminals usually commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 % of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on their ability to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful detection alone , the perpetr@@ ators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing accounts , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &apos; Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked radiator might well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V operates rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper surface of the cockpit falls off . &quot;
HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
&quot; there is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l in raised and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like the seat of the seat , offering storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded easily , but the load height at 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat more quietly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses as many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the intelligent speed controller responds to road signs detection , and reduces the speed when needed . &quot;
&quot; but full connectivity is available only for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline shall not be liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the regional court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable if there are dangers that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; after your trip , sick holiday@@ makers will only get money back if the cause of the disease is doubt@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family had suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their entrance to the door . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that supposedly polluted sea water .
the family believed that the trip was insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not have any success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his obligations , thus judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - belongs to the general life risk .
there were only 38 kt of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; after the violence done by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
it is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , that would increase the security and also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère intends to implement the proposals for the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot;
promoting terrorism has to face punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right to deliver weapons will be am@@ ended , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered . &quot;
the last widely discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be kept in words in the words of De Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; it was a cow@@ ard@@ ly cow@@ ard in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
&quot; under constitutional law , a general prohibition of full @-@ veil conce@@ al@@ ment is problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t ban everything that you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses before the court .
&quot; the Green Party leader , Sim@@ one Peter , accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets of power and ability to act . &quot;
left party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway feeder
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are standing in traffic on the ambient road every evening in a traffic jam if they drive over the motorway &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger &quot; &quot; ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction works on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er Straße in the area between the road and the right turning lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread right from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic is getting up early , which improves the overall sequence on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s administrative district Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ way eng@@ ages on the feeder nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ yard goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only slightly lowered by the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ track above all . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated workshops continue to last , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years have to be reck@@ oned with : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal remedy , the state enterprise has deliberately chosen the bu@@ si@@ est time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected . &quot;
the traffic will be held on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students aged between eleven and fifteen years visited the staging at the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , provides the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; between September 2015 and March 2016 , most youngsters of the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Mu@@ en@@ ster and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen fighter in the southwest of Germany during the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is already well before the alarm bells no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Beauty and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an inhal@@ ation and per@@ tur@@ b@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind it , but also drugs . &quot;
not in@@ frequently sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is common especially in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , watches every two to three hours and starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is tired , tired , un@@ interrupted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to relieve the sleep problem , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité University Hospital , Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises We@@ eks . &quot;
this can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
&quot; for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , physicians advise doctors to study in sleep laboratory , in case of a disease of a day@@ time fatigue , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ ber@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; after cl@@ adding , you go to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts : regular sleep and up@@ time , do not lie too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has vo@@ iced himself to the dis@@ appo@@ inting cut of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first took gold at the World Cup Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mate , prot@@ esting his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € should no one wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the pumping system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not do so closely with the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , he would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly the case with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent supervis@@ ors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop . &quot;
airport : deta@@ ined by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the susp@@ ects had committed several bag and bag ste@@ els . &quot;
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the police from past theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year , and were very professional and very professional . &quot;
&quot; the experts of the Criminal Police Department 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had already travelled to Germany to commit crimes . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stone : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like that , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes by playing fields , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ de . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone spra@@ yed &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , articles on this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; such as the responsible property company Friedrichsha@@ in are preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after three weeks of official statements , the police pat@@ ro@@ uted official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal and one day later , police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m late i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who raises three children here , are above all irrit@@ ated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted majority police protection from v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between home @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbours open up , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which also today in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost all Main@@ zer Straße close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been swept under large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive planners from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ del are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on cast@@ ed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed with colour explo@@ sives . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately pulled into Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless re@@ constructions in former gaps that the old inhabitants crowd . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - rather people who are not so well @-@ charged , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not endor@@ se violence and destruction . &quot;
&quot; but what shall we do , if a man never listen ? &quot;
&quot; fru@@ stration is on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for zo@@ omed , which are annoying about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who prefers to go , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a ta@@ vern , can complain about noise . &quot;
all persons presented only with for@@ en@@ ames have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in the field of integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger &apos;s administration .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client from the working group suggests that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wo@@ olen coat , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking but rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought , connected with years of experience in the field of social work , just an uns@@ ett@@ ling Woll@@ m@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organizing , working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are great and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; for some time now , it has been a serious problem to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must bring the refugees to their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and job centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his / her apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not functional to rely on private dwell@@ ings , says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be lod@@ ged , as it is called so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
&quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed place , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; said Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect on the outside world .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here too , administration and volunteers are jumping . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problems , says customer frank@@ ly , &quot; &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the recent incidents , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; said Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would kill them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; said Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they have always been in the background that a new sto@@ cking of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
polic@@ y@@ makers don &apos;t hesitate to answer this question .
it is actually unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
&quot; currently there are about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter searched
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
&quot; the people surprised the two , and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in their escape . &quot;
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled the city centre .
&quot; in the case of the prosecution , the police replaced several fen@@ cers and a police helicopter . &quot;
the search went out without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell near the apartment or at their escape . &quot;

Thurin@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to the sales billion
