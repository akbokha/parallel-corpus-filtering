<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with some colleagues at the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the property of the ALRV, on a horse he did not swell for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports-aid provided the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Saturday, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was added to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the performers include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the SpringStadium, where the Lavazza prize went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Commumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">More about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small, and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively restrain regulations, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would be increased," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in order to invest in it, Trump and Clinton are almost silent."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the Republicans' state-critical tea party.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, there could be party internal discussions on Trump."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its investment programme Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand its renewable energies and demand:" a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazical trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, for instance, for Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rump, then he says he cannot be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing themselves, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a sponsor of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentral accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman arriving here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight," Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Women outweigh other reasons for their escape: "many sneak away secretly because they don't see any other way out.</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not sheltered by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and at worst misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatised, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about what has been experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know how to help, there are more accommodations only for them, Bahr demands."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, if they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabians alone, displaced women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are stories or own houses in some community establishments only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has spoken about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to approve new labor disputes in their disputes over a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more competition measures starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have failed to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to have problems, which led to the rejection of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JAC board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating employment measures starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors went on strike six times this year, the first overall cases in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"following the vote, the director of the BMA Assistance Hospital Dr. Johann Malawana returned to the rejection of the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, with the advantage of the contract to be advantageous and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands, and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to do this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed to be narrowly flaky, and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "dear friend" "Putin - according to a report five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had so behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Going out was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved by a failed coup d "état for the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shattered him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the national TV forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to return."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti wrote it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued grudge about the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian head of state, with certainty, won a bonus for Ankara that after the attempted coup d" état, he demanded support for the elected bodies of the state. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" "as an analyst."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is stated (in Russian) that he was later the head of the protocol and Chief Executive Officer of the administration staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a type of power struggle here?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin that are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to put on complaining post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin became Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia as a third term of office had violated Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another Allied ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blowers" "approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering work from a truly epic dimension to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a juggling for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is future-proof high and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last corner of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern shuttle bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team work, they were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds favorable apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be put more strongly in the future in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting of the Council, the SPD is proposing a" housing concept. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the SPD leader, Christoph Bratmann said:" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban surfaces must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the major issue in the town hall is, however, according to Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but to build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, is intended to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left desires even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, Bratmann is making a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one compensate for the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, now running bonds should be bought from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of bringing homes back into the bond price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west town of Fristen the end of the year will expire.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price-connection for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing corporations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one is removed from the aim of so-called confusion."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Holger Herlitschke said:" "for a wide majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"indeed, I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, has been lamented over the last decade of many."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and recently limited to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and once found, they can be" photographed "(via a screen shot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people exercising every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to" "take 30 minutes time", "" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "blew on deaf ears because many public embassies are boring and coming from people that look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also cosmopolitan toys that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the new will lose its appeal, and the use will fade with time."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunt, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the print.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast created a multi-competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles turnes on the suspended beam during the individual multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle title and the fifth, as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the sport season last three years, 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescued from her said that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much going on between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they each won gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign of women in the arts gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted that during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which include her typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">"this girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was murky."</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspended beam and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she recovered with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and mounted one on it with a 15,933 on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her final bear - a pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, which is called" grandma "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her floor exercise, she accused the audience of kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>
<seg id="33">"as far as Biles is concerned, the fast-spreading Tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:"</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of Phoenix's deadliest attacks for a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still raining in the mobile area."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will likely achieve record levels over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers can flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a downstream inundation in the Parish is a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Morepas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the river Tickfaw, south of Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9am, which was ever recorded."</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still shrank people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, grew strongly overnight."</seg>
<seg id="17">"he said that another step-son, who lives nearby, would have warned him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the age of 48, where she lived there."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities, and he was the only one who could swim."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the flood had spread rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported in the proximity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was completely absorbed by rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and flooding caused the rescue of residents out of their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS affiliate WWL reported that an orderly in Tangipahoa attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches that were now flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The rector of the Municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water begins to return, they will return to their homes again," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the city of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa has been closed almost two dozen roads due to the flood, and sandbags provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops."</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast."</seg>
<seg id="36">"according to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been flooded, but no reported on Friday until now."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it is still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I put forward under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I've been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three Turnerines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, the catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterly gynexin routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-competition event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the top of this sport, but so do sports classes throughout the country do not look out."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same track as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner primarily comes up in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to thank the municipalities aun innumerable young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy accessible exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality young people who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the holding of the Olympic team golds and thank you, that you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance doctors voted for a vote rejected him."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend contributions to improve the maintenance of the hours."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Assistance, announced last night in a message with:" "assistance doctors have continued serious concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat the current Occupancy Crisis and agree to treat all physicians."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "work combat measures do not achieve anything of only a little, but they already burden overloaded teams and service providers and only worry, need and interruption for the patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we spoke to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded with the Ministry of Health and other ministries positively to the concerns regarding the tutelage and whistleblowings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continuing positive engagement on other important topics - such as dispatching, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a vocational training period, training breaks, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year for the release of a government report on corruption.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"former Cabinet member Sir Eric Picles verbally interferes with the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of" sensitivities concerning ethnic and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an anti-corruption-king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter simply must call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply not removable ink to a person's finger, if they give up their vote to prevent someone to vote twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistle-blowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a Special Court ruled that the acting mayor of Luton Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either dubious or the consequence of an imitation in which one person elects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the cheating letter of letters - when older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding leaps to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladesan backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions had unknowingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of "politically correct" exaggerations concerning ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents in order to stop" harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists work on complete letterheads and envelopes of letterheads.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law facilitating an accusation based on the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photographing in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English must be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters are alone in the election cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-in checks" of the elective registration departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The Judgust in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your banker around."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, you should turn yourself first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the gun line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with the knee in the lath and twist, while the aggressor jumps up from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggressor on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip, before they move backwards and set the weapon on him."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious examination by laying down some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk paid his course on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before laying each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get in."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea to lick the flush button of a train toilet, which has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Lord Wright was known for testing the resilience of his intestines, traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings at stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task turned their immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said," As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just able to do justice to his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probation screed showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminance number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands were of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validation Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to Ian to lick them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least use products containing lactic acid bacteria included."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social housing after a delogiation with a damage in the amount of £50,000, because they had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treportcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls exhibited gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared against the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikers and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloded her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogivings were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of them said: "they didn't bother anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogy is always the final step that Cornwall Housing is taking into account. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extreme and their deeds for their neighbors had to be awful.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloving on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mounds that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial law.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were graffiti covered.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are lesbians who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the delogification is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self reproach as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who don't listen and Erdogan is lying on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection-seekers to escape from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" "some hundred thousand", "the chairman of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with several hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already crossed Kurdish strongholds with impunity some months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the persecuted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were still fighting."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that assimilates refugees, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alawittic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven over the past hundred years," Toprak said, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"the chief of the association called for the German government to be" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"until 2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more than now it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and agricultural elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, volunteers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of the vote, can only be laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern needs to pass an election campaign almost over the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in the polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the countryside, distributing roses and talking a little bit with the people, just as he did his legendary, eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, soul ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the thrill of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create this" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like doing election campaign at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale events; Merkel's federal government is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the North East CDU waives largely on the usual election results on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, according to Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that you crumble the base on the land that it has to exert itself very hard to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly there is in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but the advice of the CDU campaigner Koko to his comrades is also self-revealing:" they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats recently concluded by 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the 2011 election, the SPD (SPD) had still clearly gained 35.6 per cent ahead of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of vacations and mostly lay their campaign on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," calls the president Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green electoral campaigners go on search for local voters under the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty shaky," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"also praised is the receipt of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up residence journeys."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now depart from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in part, there were considerable complaints," says the Deputy Principal Manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping tracks were looking for and rather than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself spot on the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three times a minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the speed-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"however, since the construction site has continued, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 sanitation has led to sales collapses, everyone who asks is scrutinized."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are, therefore, produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decline", "but also admits that" "course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales revenue is based on "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The street renovation took its place "two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt on request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, replied that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are less frequent passing by because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also somewhere else nice."</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family climate is coming back after the renovation works.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner sees the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="10">"as Minister of the Interior, however, he was on results and at a" realisable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, the Maizière gave a little time to complete his conclusions for the security of the Republic."</seg>

<seg id="14">Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security officials is not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"this will be difficult for the SPD," says the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that the coalition partner already has no chances."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partially in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are picked up in the country should have their smartphones checked before and social media accounts are to be exposed to a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before, such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things have an even negative effect and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - for example - in the imbalance of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, the Maizière says that it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people were deeply busy, could not be clung out in election campaign hours."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">"with regard to internal security, Union and SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, between the two parties, it was high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy-collecting collection of some Unions Home Secretary, in which the department leaders also demand a Burka ban and a return from double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">"here, too, de Maizière is struggling for conciliatory sounds."</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a return from the double pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="9">"sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, posted sales of 14 percent below the previous year's level."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Germany's home market, deliveries dropped by almost a sixth."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle-aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section to reap it under the pseudonym non-allelic male middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foresight at age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely pair of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly stuffed before I stopped, keeping my hands and something whisper like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slow in its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where independent salesmen once lived - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow it home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a sizeable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early seers who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people have usually emptied their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a store such as Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took an impulse to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that call happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is the case with me as a collector, and I think that it is so with many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally get involved.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flees from a stack of plates."</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I flatten out of a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musical."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly getting purer."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts offers the latest synthesize and sexpacker pop instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but psychic traumas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more of a window-shopping experience than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she doesn't deserve much, so the collection of disks is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression of mushing jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a stairwell, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they are not taken into account at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebee on Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator who raises nothing of middle-aged men across the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely traceable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the demolition was the Jungle Book Kids" Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp. "</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café alive.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closing of" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji issued a master class in handling, side stepping, backrest, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Gold Medal."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the boys, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but independently of this, Fiji could have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but probably it won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game in Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to surprise the attacks GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in running busses. the World Series Winner went 5-0 upwards, than Osea Kolinisau standing in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"four minutes later, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a stockpile of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but Fiji only stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, Veremalua turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Nakarawa added a new member since the rematch, and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half."</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tacklings from the GB team and ran to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning about it."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted basic changes in the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova to a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sulphists, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinalised gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first strokes to the last, 220 severe Pieve that entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"there were three voices in the boat even if there were only the two of them sitting at the helm. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that set such a standard."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.3 unwritten application, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers, who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was nobody hitless than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked something."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky to be treated at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the proper term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts on Williams, who had a nerve-riding morning spent a little more than usual, and thus tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked for.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, panning and glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen cried," Stay in the process, remain in the process. ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding with her own Steve Background TV adventure.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Champion."</seg>

<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-depleted and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing systems for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"at first, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is required."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts have been particularly important for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in view of our" "Steel is Future" "campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions trading business climate and employment targets are to be weighed," IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past year, the situation further exacerbated when the world's largest producer of producers threw steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations in price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last but not least, ThyssenKrupp wanted to avoid concluding individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: sing good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehramming study she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and to organise, to be able to leave and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, singing had a much higher significance; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people stirs many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers decompose for long recumbent events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrating on one's voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people who live alone do so, not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do something for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have various options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone is singing from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors' choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with Internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">"she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but I have already been able to leave it."</seg>
<seg id="4">They planned their journey home at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphalon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life-life district."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the early morning, two explosives went up again, according to the authorities another man was killed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the popular beach beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured following police information."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coast police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast as well as in Chumpon on the south-eastern coast demanded several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the attacks, also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks did not arise in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact date and location."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed its officials across the country to reinforce the safety of important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are still smaller bomb attacks, but most of the time they are not against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the suspicious explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending to follow the instructions given by Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits to the military great influence also in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military junta, which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody civil strife, continued to support the Kingdom for stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack on a popular Hindu shrine had killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="13">This is not a prayerful advertising for one's own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there were reports on contacts of the" identities "of AfD politicians from several federal states."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not know what to do."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extremist, and becomes so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase of legal convictions and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maate said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>

<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Maate expressed that many transgressions went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying thing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of asylum seekers have previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed crimes which previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent, or have voted for example CDU, SPD or Linke, which, however, have become radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic Games or World Records will determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently turned into a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 runners."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to populate swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, have just wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">"some media referred it as" "roubles of the whale". ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"in reference to a" "well-being", "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a pre-run over 100 meters Freestyle alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at that time, Moussambani was fired on frenetically."</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage treatment will increase at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>

<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from world food, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the budget."</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees amounts to between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt stated that a new calculation of the fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the preceding calculation period can also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt explained the serious increase in fees for all three sewage systems with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, during the reclamation period of all three plants, refurbishment and repair expenses in all three plants fell to a considerable extent, not least due to their age."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the thigh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt stated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the waste water system Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage ponds had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses came from the continued care and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully penetrated.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in addition, Schmidt explained that the market community has been spared from large entertainment costs for sewage installations over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the long run by the view of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater-purpose association could not be extended because of its lack of public facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-flowered, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All false cuts arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused, that the App Blackface would promote or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week gave some users a filter that gave them sling eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, was that the filter was" "infringing and ringing". ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pushed into the absorbing extremum."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diversed in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than it used to be, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to erase her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy will reflect a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu also criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that made Snapchat largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a staff member who focused on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said that she will let her Snapchat account be closed and added," "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.". ""</seg>

<seg id="2">"United States Central Command, military personnel of the United States Central Command, changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Party Committee members, intelligence committees and military budget commites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically defiled by high-ranking CentCom commanders, reported a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom extend to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders under Obama have instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it did to the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom descendant publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already commence in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worrying about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom encircled an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," "Mr Schiff," "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "harmed morals among analysts and" "gave disproportionately little room for divergent opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr Schiff and the democrats stated that no evidence of a White House intervention could be found at CentCom analysts with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, who after complaints by CentCom analysts commenced."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations also have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush proposed only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker declared that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom's damalous command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticised by members of the legislature for its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows: the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remains unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising peg through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the past London games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things into a better one."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely plucked the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torrigen in the first half of the game with a backpack from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro's events are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the crossbow guard to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's talk in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the Controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast, or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partially in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: guns shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely noticed that many of those I had interviewed didn't know that it is actually a Olympic portal."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes competing, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, pike and balances) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallions hoping to go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the top and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in televised broadcasts a further mocking goal: the world or the Olympic record."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, likewise at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beam out the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air rinding, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that ninety protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid West ally with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the government to suppress - the opposition in the country has been limited, where dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you want to suppress people and have no other options unless you protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions escalate along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo-liberating Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who were forced out more or less in the last few years, could use the turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of before being tinktine under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services have improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians saw that they were assembled in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and dominating the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in an unpublicized illness in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and to render them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," Mr. Abdi said, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of people protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in the last months and that time of unrest walked relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misdeeds of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersian city, attacked by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to break down in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi said," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement that Obama was founded by ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings out his co-workers, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, to declare statements which he could not even mean."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump went back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews, he thought the accusation was totally serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism encapsulates Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack out Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics, and then return it as needed."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more etched note as his survey data has gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing his attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocatively his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent hands-on advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true, in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it Hinterbänker, totally wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being biased against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, miserable "television experts trying to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology than just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Codas last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricklaying in her book" 97 Orchard "tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, örkellosem snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacked, this was fitting the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women boiled for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the roads with which the country turned into being no longer the land of Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," "Coe said why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a" "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers", "because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, because a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over flavor or even healthy kitchen understanding."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, you prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, drove the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeepers "and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating-attitude."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-arks usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks receive offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark is leisurely swimming along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland would become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-serpentine measured them, when they furnished six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, prey made this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver, which tortures from higher water layers down."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks who catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lentils.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, was to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons research dragged large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lentil, on the other hand, had a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempts, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland-arks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in its lentil-core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter long grass shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication became apparent at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no accident that such methusals live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal shed heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eytagal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage trip from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the registrants in the course of two years, the round of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage tour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"different pilgrimages were tested and finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's goal was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mercy."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and hallowed rooms went their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and blessed the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrim's path from Münster began."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and evening."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a break to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish church of the local parish was at your disposal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller gave a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed Furtwangen to Gütebach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after that came the stage to St. Peter, which was the exhausting stretch of road, but at first some 500 metres altitude had to be descended and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met at Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Scotsman Callum Skinner is stormy home, when Briton won Gold for Radsport"</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on the anchorage, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the World Cup Championships in London, despite the Hoys withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was Jamie Staff's replacement.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindu, Kenny - who prevailed with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner scored an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standpoints the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he was tight, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove round in a higher gear, to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked down from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner said," "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic champion and beat the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at Kenny and Hoys, Hinder admitted that he intentionally fell on the train after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a phenomenal victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindi said:" "it feels like London with all the UK flags."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-speed race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday he had disputed himself with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team is relying on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton played in April in the midst of sex and mosobbingvores as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland based on the abolition of energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby raises all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt consumption accounts for around 10 percent of the entire production of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting pot of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risks closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force since November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month period of notice so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL expects that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the supplier of electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual shutdown amounting to $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is yet another explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a result of the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn against the possible closure of the melting furnace in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts" statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 900 MW each year with around 900 MW of electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems should disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it wouldn't be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashyan-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the popular September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians), scary reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz Onkel and Producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all have a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is the clichéd act of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you?, "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have beaten her Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover celebrities is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been reviewed before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, more" celebrities, the modeled "as" models, the celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 and one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small probability that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even though everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her" "Mistakes of the Moment". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the wrong side, the point seems to pass by."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was pretty clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="10">"for a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity, not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as we did in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in witty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most busy walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third running steg, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitated according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have had similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus increases its dayside of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once believed to inhabit, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans were evaporating and her water vapour was burnt away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere was left to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware effectively attack companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partially repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks, according to the observations of Malwarebytes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be redeemed is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes director Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the software programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place rapidly in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working on a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users find their personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is closed."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is hit."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies affected sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely break their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure researched the areas of use and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat on how to pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk profits from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers become more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more probable that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="38">Over 50% of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey rely on their ability to repel Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful detection alone, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing accounts," explains Malwarebytes director Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V operates rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper surface of the cockpit falls off."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded easily, but the load height at 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do his job somewhat more quietly."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses as many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and the intelligent speed controller responds to road signs detection, and reduces the speed when needed."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but full connectivity is available only for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is already well before the alarm bells no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, thus an inhalation and perturbation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"at the moment, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found behind it, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is common especially in case of depression," says Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, watches every two to three hours and starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is tired, tired, uninterrupted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to relieve the sleep problem, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité University Hospital, Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in snoring with respiratory failure, physicians advise doctors to study in sleep laboratory, in case of a disease of a daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if you don't find the cause of a disturbance disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fibertin. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cladding, you go to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping-ends."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts: regular sleep and uptime, do not lie too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a remainder of cobblestone: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that, but the police are one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in the past few weeks, articles on this" trendy neighborhood "such as the responsible property company Friedrichshain are preferred with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after three weeks of official statements, the police patrouted official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal and one day later, police and construction workers removed from sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm late i."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are above all irritated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted majority police protection from vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between home-occupiers and their neighbours open up, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which also today in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost all Mainzer Straße close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been swept under large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elective planners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigadel are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on casted slices or freshly painted facades, which were jettisoned with colour explosives."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately pulled into Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless reconstructions in former gaps that the old inhabitants crowd."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - rather people who are not so well-charged," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not endorse violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but what shall we do, if a man never listen?"</seg>
<seg id="36">"frustration is on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for zoomed, which are annoying about color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="9">"an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought, connected with years of experience in the field of social work, just an unsettling Wollmsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are great and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time now, it has been a serious problem to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must bring the refugees to their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the municipality and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his / her apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find any private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not functional to rely on private dwellings, says Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be lodged, as it is called so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but only with apartments, it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed place, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," said Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect on the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and volunteers are jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problems, says customer frankly," "people with nothing at all." "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," said Regine client quite clearly, "what some naive might call." a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," said Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always been in the background that a new stocking of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">Policymakers don't hesitate to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently there are about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
