Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal raised by Obama to deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting was rejected by reference to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a slightly z@@ ump@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bling on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both studied Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 he had to deal with stress . &quot;
lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic approach to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb started his work at the University with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of Lam@@ bs &quot; long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women . &quot;
&quot; all girls had melted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were performing both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clean@@ up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community took part in a candle light memorial service on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two would ever have married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workforce for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres across the country . in 2014 , 4@@ 5.000 workers were recru@@ ited . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees increases from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons as well .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated hammer and a length of as@@ say that I am about to be with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to join forces and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the General Assembly &apos;s Minist@@ erial Meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mr Schulz called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , as some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down , it has ( yet ) not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start asking themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps staying power and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
d@@ umps of popularity have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pres@@ et state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he doesn &apos;t have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their scholars , Repub@@ lican voters are holding tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can view tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ umps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a brief majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change your mind . &quot;
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump nick@@ named &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the lim@@ eli@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for around half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider rather than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ishly angry . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods &quot;
&quot; the most expensive residential complex is located here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; on average , a square meter of a roof roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros in the street . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is most expensive .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the prizes is just like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double bull@@ sh@@ ank in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ äus a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the gre@@ ek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth launch of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th consecutive victory in the Champions League , Müller received a good help from Olympic @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion a f@@ lange of thought . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , however , they often lead to works . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by game reloc@@ ation on left sau@@ cers of Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k fell out of the right half @-@ field in the upper right @-@ hand corner .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer , Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto used his knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could bet needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but the door @-@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was a reli@@ ance .
&quot; for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot from ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain link with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , back after muscular problems in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Champion gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; said sports steering committee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ ale in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria @-@ fans , in their audience block , apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with whi@@ st@@ les against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; anyone who smo@@ kes , thereby hur@@ ts not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : this reduces the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , the DI@@ f@@ E emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gum inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers are writing in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health down to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by lack of tooth@@ lessness , distributed the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is constantly being drawn up as a specialist for archae@@ ology ground preservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction stage of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were finally found . &quot;
&quot; it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves has been found , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman gr@@ asp@@ ed by freight train
&quot; after a young woman is un@@ lucky at the railway station in the Gei@@ er@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern railway station , the Federal Police asks the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , it has borne the most serious injuries by capturing the train . &quot;
she was treated by emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal equ@@ ation of the young woman , the educ@@ ating function@@ aries have no knowledge . &quot;
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bak@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to vali@@ date the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to which citizens trust , &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , responsible for the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely demonstrate that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they are to be equal parts of the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate last few months it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Dis@@ pu@@ te Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , the companies will be able to pay compensation for damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , bro@@ aden national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act marked the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised that they are not to be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German Economic Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into account the reform essential points , the Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel elabor@@ ated in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is at the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association of Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now . &quot;
&quot; originally , there should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singers filmed the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he re@@ counts on the basis of various places he repeatedly records on the map of his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
&quot; where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can be dri@@ fted in great opul@@ ent style at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the near of the Rhin@@ eland , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook on certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
&quot; live with him , guitar and ban@@ jo . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the musician who lives in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) will be released in 2005 . &quot;
overl@@ apping of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks any annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then serves on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; since long ago the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ tapes and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ely held Hamburger L@@ earn more !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; disk &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens makes a modest contribution to an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows with thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly anticipated in the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs close by . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to pause on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the British Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; within the Labour and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron who has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade across the dis@@ patch cabinet in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the dispute with re@@ tain@@ ers and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the Shadow of Economic Ministers , if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid objective . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and most successful estimates of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
&quot; the pound jumped by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , bringing brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competitor group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - is again reporting growth .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % , after mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by selling stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports climbed 3.1 % , after the sports training company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
J@@ D Sports CEO states that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labor costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da @-@ poster Br@@ ings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato@@ lian Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both are both in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ ement owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen accidentally on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , the store has a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has since been registered in the Patent Office in Munich by the Lebanese .
&quot; there , it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority . &quot;
&quot; like lots of meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
met@@ ro@@ cash launches ground insur@@ gency campaign to combat emer@@ gen@@ cies
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ ering has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ ering and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops rehear@@ s@@ als and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ ering will publish more details of its defensive strategy on September 29th , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and take away all available actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA @-@ retailers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ering loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ ering will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ a refused to publicly comment on Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ ering has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ G@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which accounts for around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operating debt while printing on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week , and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs will grow to El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator . Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to go to Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sh@@ attered a tennis ra@@ cket , after crashing a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite jeal@@ ous about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the argument , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan during the important decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the lim@@ eli@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , stops refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held up all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants caught up in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with ou@@ trage . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants chan@@ ted &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some rejected food and water protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; Parliament must still agree to the military use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
&quot; chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 were able to enter , but thousands were outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit leap forward in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite the ground .
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders came second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s benefit in democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit leap in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections say that they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ tons supporters say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate democr@@ ats for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters sees Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic constitu@@ ents call questions about elec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts out best in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be provided as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the term of office , most democratic voters of the primary elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not been influenced altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of voters do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters are also aware of Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good marks when conducting . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are the best candidates for hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son shifts closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , half of voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is dispens@@ ed with , and others lose their grip on hold . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters continue to support nationwide tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received in demographic groups and over@@ comes Tr@@ ump under Repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator , Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump told last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at present warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing tourists already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen section .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was im@@ potent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of serious attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ officially - we will also take this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local population . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rise in interest comes , and the house is sl@@ umped , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find out that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
&quot; here , a view based on historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield should be honoured 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is usually in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate rise , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and returns returns .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a net interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP by 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed all year to raise the net interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all cre@@ asing cycles from 1950 to date have been taking place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and placed pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile because the market anticip@@ ates interest rate rise , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than at stocks when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to drawing closer ties between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest increase , Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital margins and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does something , which the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; mu@@ te &quot; &quot; and increasingly can no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also referred to BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC Director General denied the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I am learning about Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that &apos;s really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , came under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stable , &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to make the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the dealer for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
&quot; for over a decade virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with just five percent increase over the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now it comm@@ its itself , and we will probably see that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers explored their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spent a little over £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia part of the collapse of part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ at . &quot;
&quot; crowded , dressed largely in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed by the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beg@@ gar . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King passed a san@@ ction over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the crane stop when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over large building projects .
&quot; al Qaeda &apos;s de@@ ceased leader , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials mand@@ ated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent wounded .
others will receive half of this amount .

&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q stores will close nationwide &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans , who perform work in their home &quot;
&quot; if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this to a balance more strongly .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; king@@ f@@ isher is the only company that has just 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profits and sales after the Group reduced the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new stores . &quot;
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and discrimination on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt national court .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was accused of abuse of authority .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted defini@@ tively in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the tor@@ ney @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used funds from association accounts for private purposes between 2006 and 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ence .
&quot; this fact divided the president of the Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the defence was a proof of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that at no time an asset had been created by the association .
&quot; sports officials had only calculated expense allowance and the sports club for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the Brot@@ bure@@ au , told the chief account@@ ant of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have proposed money to lay down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it &apos;s not allowed to pay any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all @-@ inclusive and non @-@ detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and austerity books shared the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial statement , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , when an official investig@@ ator was investigating for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that said , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and according to his statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer . &quot;
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage repar@@ ation . &quot;
why compensation ? judges wanted to know prosec@@ ut@@ ors and prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer is saying , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only paid mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; he took charge of the association 1.000 euros per month for diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an operational test in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared . &quot;
&quot; the second defend@@ ant , too , had paid the mil@@ eage . &quot;
&quot; he explained in his statement that all the arrangements were made in cash , for which he had to travel to the Bank from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been running for three years , the Compu@@ Ter@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the US Compu@@ Ter@@ restrial H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) sub@@ missions have no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the volume of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) will be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall due in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs for the past three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share returned 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has become a company of Pal@@ o Alto , California , currently spl@@ its up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led even this year in a new society - separate from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ appo@@ inting PC market and a weaker demand for corporate customers after his services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo in the end .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year , the shipments of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; in this way , revenue declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive deliveries to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely due to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this . &quot;
29 percent were not able to decide .
car : second day on the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electric mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A of Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organisers of the Auto Association V@@ DA anticipate around 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s tear gas and water @-@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred displaced persons .
Euron@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water row@@ er ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially continued to spray the pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; now , the refugees have withdrawn something . &quot;
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees flock together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was last week of view that F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and the interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Manager at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death H@@ ad at Delta State University left behind ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong , &quot; &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
and he said that he shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles went to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who testified that she was married about seven years ago , was described as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss allegedly had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University as his way of life on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; in 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 executives around the world , group conversion will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union . &quot;
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the budget of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the objective of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year , from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team around Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict dispute with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this was shared by the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is looking for routes to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South , &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger can be seen at the Künstler@@ haus . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outer defender to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ coach , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very heavy , because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very serious injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better than the Lor@@ ax ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President ruled for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental issue published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he states to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twenty times in a row a child .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali emerged as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; message @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th escap@@ es from the England test cad@@ re , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss engaged his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forth .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first took Jonathan de@@ fi@@ ance in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance lies now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a drummer I appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire earlier this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin punch and would receive four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind anything about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 . &quot;
he made three hundred rides straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited contact with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
&quot; people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup bo@@ gs that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the coaching staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ an , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part don &apos;t have a problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ bran@@ ched ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which sharply breaks through Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , as deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers join the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an out@@ sider looking to the outside of the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point in which they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they are going to s@@ nat@@ ch one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so maybe some such ministers might intentionally not plan on inten@@ tional ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and what EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one is , as it did not support during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , phone @-@ hack@@ ed ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries that most of our large newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found out that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir itself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the non @-@ approved EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I &apos;ll put it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wil@@ der feelings of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ man can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said yet what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - news discipline is important in the era of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminiscent of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
p@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; exceedingly win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it was to receive according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he also took part . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage to most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted beforehand . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; &quot; give their right arm &quot; &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , into hard @-@ fought windows against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I think medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or give in order . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I endeav@@ our to see how this public @-@ legal television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue if they are on their seem@@ ing missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson told the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you all think , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should check their &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate , train and maintain . &quot;
he said that only little from BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television channels in Australia and Canada to change in &quot; inform and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances will go into alliances to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching off mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report &quot; &quot; Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , the worms genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulse of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons susceptible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells .

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stops and underground trains , which require a second look . &quot;
&quot; important notice : from September 15th to 18th with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns to the image of a tank . &quot;
&quot; in September , a s@@ warm of weapons retailers will travel with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers will be asked to help at the stop of the ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot;
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel design in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
&quot; a collective named Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of in@@ bus keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of bus stations on the planet will gain access . &quot;

one of the Par@@ o@@ dy ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
&quot; according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Design and Associ@@ ate at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries . &quot;
many artists engage with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters regards commuters in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works non@@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the weapons trade fair - by a laying of the Excel @-@ calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a realistic z@@ wi@@ light company advertisement , but &quot; through the single @-@ ring with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
&quot; perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors sh@@ out fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot;
&quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order from the US army on &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS shot by the shoulder . &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student dwell@@ ings ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ atter : tell people where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ty , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages @-@ reception des@@ ks , movie night venues and communal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress and put on their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student is tired of con@@ vivi@@ ality , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship Inclu@@ des through B@@ aking .
&quot; since you start college at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked them something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you tap . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate , who added a washing @-@ up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise which keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being an independent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , if they had something to make drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors asleep for two hours before pl@@ under@@ ing her own music , closing her door and proc@@ eeded to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come into the same residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go to them , dis@@ connect , and then see them every day and perhaps witness how they all come over together to each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety by plu@@ gging - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you place in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single educ@@ ating mother and the hel@@ per . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in the face of the flood of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
&quot; this is different , if you put people in blocks of flats . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units each for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
the houses can then be converted easily according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I did my project properly and legally .
&quot; particularly complicated , it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ ordin@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate competition for affordable housing ?

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the merging of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to an update of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start to the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and won the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; founded three months ago , Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times . &quot;

&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein met . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ku have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point on the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new qu@@ arti@@ san office was opened there recently .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , immediately sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health care and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been finding out with our ambul@@ ant nursing service that often informal car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .

&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training , or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
&quot; for this reason , a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future is essential . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus won an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the outer . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;
&quot; par@@ ked : Tim Wiese , casting a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money &quot;
former foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was dis@@ liked in Bremen .
&quot; the foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and near Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim was engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot;
he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not assign it intellectu@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bremen , Wiese was just cutting his hair when he saw a parking space wat@@ cher out there for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese burst out of the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and accused her of the delicate fine of money before the feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; paper . &quot;
&quot; one confirms the accus@@ ations by the City of Bremen , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only afterwards I decide whether a meadow will be shown or not .

male Pro@@ verb@@ s on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ oral . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried now to the young , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ ckets , he first dismissed from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man has now been brought home . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a car to their home , and went there demonstr@@ atively several times . &quot;
&quot; when the car was no longer seen , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male .
&quot; by means of an impact @-@ stick , one re@@ counts on the face and the upper thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; so far , there is only a vag@@ ue situation description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests EUR 3@@ 10,000 &quot;
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller , from left to hand , take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Rock . &quot;
&quot; also , joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ eck Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel R@@ aus@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital , who will also go into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel rock @-@ breaks and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the mil@@ ler liked the idea of pursuing his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one agreed , the mil@@ ler bought the house with practice . &quot;
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and volunte@@ ered for the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ doctor . &quot;
&quot; therefore the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EC@@ Gs and need a consulting room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler receives a subsi@@ dy of 50@@ 000 euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; emphasizes Zambia Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice every quarter according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if there was no successor , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours also continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the medical doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel says , smiling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little sad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always been pushing for gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; corridor &quot; - denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to leave the refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is what the Minister of the Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach , however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar stressed . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass by in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registering . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , ever since , police vehicles with new refugees arrive in T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already being used .
&quot; in the coming days , his country is counting about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was a way of propos@@ ing certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor will we do this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id in the morning , and more buses would be expected during the day . &quot;
&quot; from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it could indeed be a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ lying route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; the Minister of the Interior of Croatia , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had stressed beforehand that his country prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
on Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to so@@ ot@@ he Wednesday morning at a local court appearance in Hor@@ gos : he halts the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be about very high refugee numbers .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
migrants advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which is accused of having gained insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Cyber@@ and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the information carried out , insi@@ der stores should have been made available to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; thus , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the USA and in Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their own err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly lo@@ af@@ ing . &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , col@@ os@@ sal life with wonderful autumn sunlight and in the midst four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively raised its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the director of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ ms my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; on the br@@ ink of small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onal plant Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate on the tablets publicly , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people . &quot;
an estimate that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and funeral service is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe looked for volunteers by a call , she immediately reported and had been there when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied by relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all well trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , precious and precious for the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of an out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
there are also more personal wishes to be recorded on postcards .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in the previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of fac@@ t@@ set , analysts expected $ 10,@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; the lower prospect comes in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on January 4th and despite higher fees for body transports of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; solid earnings if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot;
&quot; plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by twelve analysts credited by Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , revenue increased by 29 percent during the body transport , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about one hour before opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; facing them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story se@@ ash@@ ore there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just about a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do to make the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate increase this week .
&quot; financial markets , however , expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to have a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase in the sentence expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered for the end of last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow being nearly 10 % below the market . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he is predic@@ ting that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest increase , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England &apos;s Bank of Inter@@ est Rates . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 runs .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande stimulates nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good food is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who su@@ ck on breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a powerful immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ halle construction at Bern@@ ese sports grounds are moving step by step : during the recent meeting of the municipal council , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously denied without much discussion . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the committee had previously approved an application for a construction legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof roof &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this creates a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; deliver@@ ance , &quot; again , it was about the ti@@ lt of the roof , which for energy reasons - differently than in the building plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was necessary because the development plan regarding the ti@@ lt @-@ ti@@ lt did not permit any &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council usually drives more restric@@ tive in liber@@ ating applications . &quot;
&quot; the Turn@@ halle Construction is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymnas@@ tics hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Land Council Office for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the District Church of the District , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board will decide on this and will meet on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ on@@ gau with Fischer and the remaining In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ on@@ gau should be offered a work@@ station , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who should succeed , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who agreed to take the lead as of 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
&quot; over the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ shaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Federal Reserve , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ time sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer of the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not been given . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again and again in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the manus@@ cripts of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ isches HC .

Jag@@ ha@@ zy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police cleared . &quot;
&quot; after shooting a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital . &quot;
it was unclear at first how exactly this happened to the accident .
the secret police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the funeral of 16 @-@ year @-@ old people from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a crime of violence since Saturday .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday .
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was arrested on Tuesday evening was also deemed to have been indic@@ ted and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Sunday morning .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest was reported to the authorities in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death . &quot;
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid homes .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; Association . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the tenants .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee numbers . &quot;
the study also makes considerable savings in housing policy in recent years .
Germany will be a housing deficit that will grow from year to year .
&quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ h@@ ely in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; because of the loud noises on the housing market , young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; thus , the income tax would be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee housing of the Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the currently available tot@@ aling some 300 million euros was retri@@ eved . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia use corridor
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that crossing over Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia seeks to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Ministry of the Interior and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the firing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day do not obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia seeks to pass refugees back .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of these media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across borders . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the border stri@@ pe poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 accessed people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing of the door on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws enforce the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned threaten sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the tr@@ ash which tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the reception wareh@@ ouses in the border location was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the aim of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still living in the country according to the government &apos;s indications . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy on Sunday after the bridge , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins may@@ ors Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany unexpectedly suspended rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first roasted the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we just said we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers moved from an ICE train to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short @-@ term pro@@ clamation that the railway was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was shut down at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing generally is high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ alized , day before a branch run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially lifted the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the P@@ oultry will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for those seeking shelter . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; with the assistance of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is familiar with the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first tak@@ e@@ off centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , were also accommod@@ ated without a fuss , said Con@@ rad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 lod@@ gings in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial authorities .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it runs well in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator , too , sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ fen like us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that districts must respect a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the obligations . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Con@@ rad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not tell fal@@ seh@@ ood without further into the face . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er bear no costs for the Republic , as they said . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; so far , the company &apos;s own district search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of city sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the city chief advises against the division of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) dealt with the further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans now .
the Next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz has been officially concluded . &quot;
&quot; the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Swoboda . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies in the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire some of them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; a total of 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the plant , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
&quot; in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to grow a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she grew up in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve wondered for a long time whether I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Vene@@ to producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big area Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; for me , most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag are in rap@@ ture , the specialist cannot answer with last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag is enhanced by every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses himself to foreign enemies , med@@ d@@ ling journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is whi@@ r@@ ling the election campaign strongly . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair@@ do is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style &quot; , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native of K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , which include Tr@@ ump as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ zi@@ cally the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the perim@@ eter , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ ors . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy . their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Do@@ gs , Roland Paul , declared the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Polish , this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the Americans rather distant , &quot; he is always so thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ weed Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ , which is generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t know the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA who are interested . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hands of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a maximum of 2500 inhabitants may have a mountain climbing village .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the ratings for today . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull abol@@ ished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers because Sun@@ rise reached an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five major cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , today it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 was achieved . &quot;
&quot; Sun@@ rise has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in September at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators in September . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these min@@ ers more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are al@@ right , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently @-@ wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
average hot @-@ se@@ at an average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine hop@@ eful that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.@@ m .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly appear who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before out of three , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the vic@@ tor . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could become their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; from the very first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and observed S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who to choose Wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first punch @-@ return on Tuesday doing 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his cat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al range led to a ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee figures , the free voters demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; leader of the party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Greater Malawi : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get audi@@ ts in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the free elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
other main topics were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; of course the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to get to the causes , &quot; said Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ ans demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for filing for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ verter , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy should not fall under the table in Grand @-@ Wall@@ stadt . &quot;
a long @-@ standing long @-@ standing hit is on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ grade plus &quot; &quot; at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sia in which an extension of the high school secondary school of three to four years will be tested . &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums wanting to do that .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , wherever you want . &quot;
stronger Wall Street helps Da@@ x jump on the jumps
&quot; the German stock market closed , following a long @-@ haul , trend @-@ free and nervous trade history with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer opening of the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
&quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value was 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;

&quot; in London and in Paris , strong gains were also bu@@ oy@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index last noted around 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to be replaced until after the interest rate in the US , and also for the large decline on the fut@@ ures tra@@ ded on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the debate about the loads from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to record a record low , leaving deep traces even at E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may be defici@@ ent in provisions of 30 billion euros . &quot;
the Federal Government has denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Da@@ x , Infin@@ eon stocks increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the branch association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers from the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers were 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .

the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the course of the euro sank in the afternoon to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west from the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternatives , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
building site planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there is still no concrete offer . &quot;
Em@@ den - the city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter property in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say , from the city . &quot;
the investor question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located at the Ring Road / corner Great Street already a few months ago and let the building be torn down .
the P@@ ieve Project : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure time
&quot; for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the small sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on the offensive from the construction management board : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in discussion for months about ten to twelve million euros .
&quot; violent reactions among Meer@@ bu@@ da owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ de owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ting that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he is also afraid of a number of other project critics that the transport would increase sharply with the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; entire bus loads must come in order to expect that , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the area of the former restaurant , which is just over a hect@@ are area , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;
twin offspring in gor@@ illas at the Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to offspring with its gor@@ illas .
the 26 year old Di@@ an gave birth to tw@@ ins yesterday .
twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare at gor@@ illas .
&quot; the last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and in 1967 was also in Frankfurt , it is said of the zoo . &quot;

Google launches campaign donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ raising campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as were hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised , up to a value of 5.5 million , will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / ground up to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of losing weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrients .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % partly dissolved . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , writes the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the guiding scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ erec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater rel@@ ap@@ ses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit in the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show any benefit to survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe could not take in all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tackl@@ ing the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries will be reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never resolved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , who strongly swallow the alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ infection agents while some are doing it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ iny in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fra@@ me@@ works which are very appealing to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in infants , few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre in K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky sit around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection medium within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of a straw@@ berry @-@ based hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was prescribed by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah stra@@ ined her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario killed women after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teacher by taking anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
the police considered the disgu@@ ised plan as a &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged
&quot; in the event of a rear @-@ end collision between Nordr@@ ing and Hun@@ ting , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist has been easily injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver headed towards the industrial area in the direction of the round@@ about , and it was too late that two pre @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he pran@@ ced into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a front @-@ standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the event of accident @-@ related vehicles , kind damage of about 10 000 euros was created , the police reported . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian CEO s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
coming together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January @-@ transfers

&quot; Br@@ ent@@ ford &apos;s ex @-@ boss said , &quot; The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Mc@@ Cloud is happy to win against Hamilton .
&quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen fought desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive League victory , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic to the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said , &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who didn &apos;t win games of this kind either . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases altogether . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Schot@@ t@@ land &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken people bot@@ her@@ ed the process

why I Will witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for late legal action , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have been better articul@@ ated , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase is persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &apos; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
sports football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape the control of alcohol and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals for the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race straight away .
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t tu@@ g test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations , and did not want it to &quot; look like too much hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name when asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point that I don &apos;t care about , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s Fru@@ stration levels have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching has said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a pack had been laid on the equ@@ ine of mud or clay , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been like yesterday all day , which was also the case . &quot;
but it had it so on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all agree that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested for driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver escape in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police presented himself in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with rider cur@@ ses and failing aid and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy champi@@ ons ri@@ vals because of alle@@ gations relating to w@@ rest@@ ling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the &quot; &quot; E@@ Q@@ AS &quot; &quot; to be allowed with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely covered note to the Storm Team , after winning the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that at Tac@@ kl@@ ing they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team is confident , as it means that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time comes up again and again at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a cra@@ p . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
&quot; again , Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are p@@ auses , and no points something exciting ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly threatening a lifel@@ ong sentence because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argued by Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been in the cafe from a harmless background . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal complaint , he lied the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ est statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily to the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks participating had stopped in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police cleared . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing user is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; then Ho@@ gg claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ da@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to scar@@ ing people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said that he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year . &quot;
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not to appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders because he could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit in this case , but was held in detention for hear@@ ings on other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad @-@ user access to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates left people from fear of discovery and arrest of people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the refuge Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and dust guns on the German side .
&quot; there , they are accepted by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; compared to the week of the week on Wednesday , the Munich central train station clearly exceeded the number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people came to the state capital alone until 8 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm clouds in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in the past days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ üste with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 mph . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the autom@@ akers show their new products at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , it is primarily a movement with the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment , according to the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry below the largest competitor of VW Golf , starting at 17@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra competitor &quot; Mé@@ gan@@ e &quot; into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan Ab@@ bot will find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its sweeping lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; the maximum torque is , according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions , at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger placed hand in front of the front section : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system has been modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the spl@@ itted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the legal pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , deta@@ inees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision which was published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Justice and instructed the case back to it again . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court therefore decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , from the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a dimin@@ ution of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; only in April they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee compensation , because he was locked up naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason prisoners are locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even for ra@@ ckets it should have arrived because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of junior managers , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what happens in Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we create that . &quot;
&quot; what is coming to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : each year between 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social hous@@ ings are out of the rental price relationship , and in order to find these particularly cheap apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social housing needs to be created every year , and the federal government should invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal construction ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt also says work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has become increasingly clear that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
&quot; until now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the Royal Road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sty@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the Administration is distributing leaflets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increases sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not forbi@@ d asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude . &quot;
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start a study .
&quot; the latter basically do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the b@@ af@@ e . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to date , to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards this can be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this gap of financing needs to be closed , too . Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in the future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern about religious conflicts in Germany on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for over a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany undertake , must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to the previously expected refugees , says doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be invested in the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered could later be invo@@ iced with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited catalogue of services will cut off the asylum application law . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors make the language barrier particularly difficult . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health researcher The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors &quot; practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees are also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; among the refugee camps there are clearly more uns@@ killed disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly different clinical pictures German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery thinks . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved of relief in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system ; some of them were doctors .
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash @-@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers can apply for a psych@@ otherapy application in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the tile .
&quot; our passion is circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ esis .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift for fan@@ atics lies in the family in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; manager Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; . &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded to the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily accommodate them . &quot;
&quot; light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of touch and ag@@ ility . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , are read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the highest bid : good for the animals .
&quot; the family Pro@@ bst is especially proud of her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are there with the whole heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from September 17 to 20 , every day . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal construction is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs by a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls was quickly spreading across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s alle@@ gations , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members concerned that the immunity in parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave the parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the division after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ rival@@ ed , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in the 1930s to produce electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto garage called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation continues to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as few also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere Dis@@ eases since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ als 157 of the league players in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs that have reported most of the infrin@@ gement days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s rice , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last in the injury quota during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a for@@ ceful period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will be a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta might start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to move on by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first European triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign Against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms observed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends only once so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication through social media , with its focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cosy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a telephone counsel@@ or employee explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider status may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G break down Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his matches against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria made less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Masters on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head@@ set in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schacht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters because they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the goal . he later became involved in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he went to Manchester United last month , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed the long corner of the grid to Johan Wil@@ and . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went past Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little help . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was at no less than five experiments alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short of the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could get back to the game , and only an excellent grip from Wil@@ and in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi made a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Nordic League , which has not the same level . &quot;
qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core collecting $ 2.5 billion by buying shares
&quot; mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sales as part of its huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about CHF 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets . &quot;
the issuing of pre @-@ emp@@ tive rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores &apos;s share price in trading on Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week $ 2.5 billion of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to ti@@ recover around a third of his 30 billion dollars .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , representing a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have declined by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; on Tuesday afternoon 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar , after a mostly long flight . &quot;
&quot; the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a State D@@ iner this evening , after the two leaders held bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President X@@ is &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is likely to meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding China &apos;s alleged Cyber@@ sp@@ ying , and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented from 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the requirement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three time tro@@ phy winner , four times champi@@ ons league winners , twice world champion , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now tells him that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 bid farewell to Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time Madrid won everything , nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ be@@ ati@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would go with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown jour@@ ne@@ yed when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives and , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producing Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove , beaten by her white stock@@ holder . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People campaig@@ ned for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their director &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion .
&quot; after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement scored a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured inhal@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement has published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck as to whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation , or has already met the Pope , is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten made up to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing at a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still below the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or have been living , &quot; Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes ; it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he had any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had exchanged the roles .
&quot; America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in the spring of 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins on Tuesday at 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within a half @-@ game of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad out . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ate tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was faced with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who got a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing run at the second , the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a &quot; &quot; Insurance Run &quot; &quot; at the end of the ninth inner ring , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pitches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the game , Detroit benefited from an un@@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the injury list before the game after he had been missing for more than a month because of a back@@ rest .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ oses gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat very well , but he did catch the right place . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count and scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the throwing training .
&quot; he is being examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
San@@ che@@ z since the middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder lashing will be activated for the start on Wednesday .
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with refugees from 450 to 750 refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily escape there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days , according to the government presi@@ dency of the government responsible for the initial survey , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective departure . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the Kel@@ ch had passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict erup@@ ts at our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive escal@@ ation of international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF and no one was sent back to Hungary .
&quot; Germany , too , did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement with which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee disaster in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , and at the end of the Tuesday evening Merkel called for almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers of the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection , also lam@@ ent this . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania will lock up with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from seeking cre@@ denti@@ als over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people crossing the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants fled to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean is s@@ apping . &quot;
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon gli@@ des easily on its track around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this motion of exchange is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , spinning the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers at that time closed . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation led to a reduction of ad@@ duction at the age of 27 divided by the association .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that makes us heavy , R@@ ama is a her@@ al@@ ded loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a non @-@ uni@@ fying professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
scor@@ er Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team workouts following his conc@@ ussion next week .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on the head .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious gl@@ es@@ sage . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
&quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot;
&quot; it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio . &quot;
&quot; and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , announced U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are looked for . &quot;
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making provisions for the Christmas business last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries made the parcel service harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first blow , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes &apos; side , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the bo@@ oming valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alp@@ illes , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the c@@ low@@ ns with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent centre @-@ country , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , since large quantities of rain have already fallen over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the hair dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front is rolling with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is growing strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures are considerably decreasing . &quot;
&quot; the following days are located in the north of aut@@ um@@ nal with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square became apparent that the tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a rotten sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions should have reinforced him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the departure deal .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated text texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up this , in order to be able to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to help art become more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today , the perception of image worlds is marked by advertising , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost visited the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , which has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he lives with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care to completely grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious topics that were important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a picture Bible originated . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which opens on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a round course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured a shot , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so the hill was de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; in October , the first public coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further break &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B strengthens commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the situation escal@@ ating in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the upcoming problems . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country ever since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I will be at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the minister of state Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
but the crucial course must be politics .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the margins of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga activists also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs are showing a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama of refugees goes on everyone , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use our jet power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz said . &quot;
&quot; Peter Ret@@ tig , Managing Director of H@@ offen@@ heim , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday .
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their places was great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; which we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will be providing 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already retri@@ eved the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP executive officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
&quot; according to several reports , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye through a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he was almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ one can happen . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you fell .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a spare drive for the two common pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button on weekends , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ out plate in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be absent from the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ ic against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
&quot; thus , he announced a change at the goal keeper position . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of pedi@@ atric Roman br@@ ush@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all the European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel was left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second part . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement made by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B must be the goal in the Europa League , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl is understandable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot car : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt , on the ver@@ ge of the IA@@ A , a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which will also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and high @-@ level switching to digital radio . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically feasible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are expected to be expected to come as far as 2020 . &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany in 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday commissioned by the Pro@@ se Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the flow in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth wouldn &apos;t leave the car under control under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
&quot; according to the current state of the title , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf plans only to strike in singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ gger Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this point in time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term partnership in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion will be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; announced single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on this , &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United settled a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights are : window mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; it was ble@@ ached in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation . &quot;
&quot; in fact he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one comes to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the scarcely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not set up chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete piece of art , for which much effort has been practi@@ sed : to fro@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators made 14 tonnes of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable side@@ walks of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery Jew@@ ellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ ull tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines were used in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make metres . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips came into being in large quantities for customers , who , for example , re@@ worked for blankets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion show . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styl@@ istic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already doing half of all orders . &quot;
fashion Show P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they must wear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
&quot; private specialist shops , and wholesale trade , are almost no longer available . &quot;
&quot; in this way , our products hardly reach the customer . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , mass production is produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively driven by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , export is weak@@ en , up to date , to Russia and the United States . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points in environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical peak of snow . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine p@@ ecks in some places small spheres . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ er Gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with a traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ er lace - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with that , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney is still vent@@ uring to a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was entrusted with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to absorb private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident reporting system . &quot;
&quot; following the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is important because it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a far @-@ right business environment and shaping the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus mi@@ tig@@ ate consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter are raised for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for economic policy reasons , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limits , approximately 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in exchange for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; declared Wolfgang sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; already small quantities , particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains , on its homepage , with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly due to the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written report from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six metric tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , European warnings about mercury in fish were among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
