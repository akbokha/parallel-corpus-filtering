&quot; this data does not need to be materi@@ ally handed over to the organization , provided that it will remain accessible by the organization in the premises of the community without further examination . &quot;
a ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) A@@ void the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time contrary to an acqu@@ itt@@ al , the organisation of the Community and the states proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if , based on the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the attri@@ bution of inspec@@ tors of the Organization , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after the General Director of the Organization - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the affected states take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can actually perform their duties . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the Organization shall be established so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
( II ) The protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , fulfilling tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the privileges and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention are concluded regarding core material , when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer use@@ able for a nuclear activity , which is under the aspect of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has practically not been re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the association notes the transfer of nuclear material from the States which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures pursuant to this Convention shall be terminated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state , as provided in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup actions on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to security measures after this Convention , shall be used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association agrees with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that , during the duration of the non @-@ application of the safety measures after this Convention , the candle is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; B ) The organization and the community make provision for the provision of safegu@@ ards planned in this Agreement , only as long as the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held by the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states on the current one . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as time and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , states or persons who are subject to their jurisdiction are incurred , however , extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been clari@@ fied in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this agreement in the same way as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or the organization concerning damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , which have emerged from the implementation of the security measures after this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council after the examination of the relevant information provided by the General Director determines that the organisation has not been able to verify that no nuclear material , which has to be subject to safety measures after this Convention , can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the statutes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; such steps take into account the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as any of the two contracting parties are concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; consult the organization , community or state consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek out , therefore , that questions arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such questions through the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of disputes which arise from the interpretation or application of this agreement , which are not agreed in the negotiation way or by another from the organisation , the Community and the states , upon request of a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states will appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed to elect a fifth who presi@@ des over the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within three days after the application for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied when the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within three days following the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; this Convention shall apply to non @-@ core powers , the contracting party of the contract and shall be members of the community , in force , i ) if the concerned state of the organization is notified that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; II ) if the association of the Organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties concerning a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all member states of the organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its proceedings have been concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this section of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the safety measures specified in this agreement is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a junction through the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a measure of securing fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the tests carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , determines the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their checks , the organization makes use of the security system of the Community after article 3 full use . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as necessary , see how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are practical : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , lost or otherwise from the existing core material and the inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; ( C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Proced@@ ures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured assets and not measured losses ;
( F ) a protocol and reporting system which indicates the core material stock and the changes in this material for each material balance zone including the one and off of the material balance zone ;
( g ) Ret@@ ur@@ ns to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this Convention are not related to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; B ) Uran@@ ium - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system described under letter c ) , shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material that is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will this core material or else , produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system , it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association and the community consult each other via the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community perceive that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when it is used in grams or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Core material , if it is used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es nuclear material , which otherwise would otherwise be subject to security measures after this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total material quantity delivered in the States is at no point at any time &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if released core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the securing measures after this agreement , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation Additional agreements which , in the scope necessary for the successful and effective enforcement of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , will determine how the procedures specified in the Convention shall be applied . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts in order for these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated inventory of the total material underlying the security measures of this agreement in the states irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of its review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program defined at the Conference on International Economic Co @-@ operation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied within six months after the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the means of funding , in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; &quot; which the Member States have to contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is governed by the organization as administrator in violation of this agreement , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest guil@@ t@@ ings of the member state , which must pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country . &quot;
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the periods necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments to the above mentioned dates on request .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school jun@@ ctions to cover the expenses for the special event loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; when granting such loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot;
to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pa@@ inst@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices financed by ordinary funds of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction must not be used instead of the funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the organization &apos;s loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years each . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
payments to the payment of this bi@@ b must be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
&quot; each special transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is specified in particular . &quot;
&quot; revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator did at the time of the loan guarantee , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of special transactions are based on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
&quot; until the complete aband@@ on@@ ment of all special transactions , the bai@@ li@@ ff informs the E@@ EC about the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of payment of the special event loan , the administrator will inform the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special event loan and the expenses made for this . &quot;
&quot; the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization , a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full issue of the special transaction accounts of time , conduct an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may make an agreement , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all bene@@ fici@@ aries earned by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States agree to the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat shall conduct these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Reg@@ ular approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each wording is equally binding . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T will issue : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE atomic community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Common Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been working with research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable every contracting party to benefit from the greatest possible benefit through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. , the common objective of this research work , i.e. , by using the controlled core fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective collaboration , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or modified by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contractual parties accept a new program , it will take place in the place of the programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the current agreement . &quot;
the Associ@@ ations envis@@ aged in Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 will be realized by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that cooperate on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project within the scope of the present agreement .
&quot; with regard to carrying out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall close an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of the human resources exchange that is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Company J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the scope of this agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are commissioned to carry out the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , must include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
to monitor the development of the research work and to ensure that the best possible results are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG &quot; - represented .
&quot; the VG , which has the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with respect to all research and development activities that this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination among the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s and focuses on the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common objective established in Article 1 of the present agreement , with which the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which provides the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , are perc@@ ei@@ ving this task with respect to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the committee of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , and which is responsible for making optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , is fu@@ eling this task with regard to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; he particularly cares for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees set up within the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees , which provide the Committee of Directors with appropriate proposals for the best use of the means , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country , responsible for nuclear and energy research . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as for the preparation of future programmes and the determination of its total size , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the merger area . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG to the preliminary actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the area of human resource exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties are working on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of this agreement .
&quot; the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set to an amount each year , which represents the share of Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Company as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects J@@ ET to the Common Company J@@ ET , which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Statute of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides to finance the work as part of the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount will be allocated to cover expenses in the context of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
&quot; the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are stipul@@ ated in Anne@@ x III , for the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of customs or other duties as well as import ban and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in this country , any objects purchased or acquired there may not be dra@@ ined free of charge nor free of charge unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves the conditions imposed by the Federal Council . &quot;
these exemp@@ tions are not applicable to he@@ aders and bodies that are paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge approved in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement shall be regulated in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge required for Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Common Company J@@ ET , are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the constitution of the Common Company . &quot;
the right of every contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel under the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;

the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , on whose application the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without being exceeded a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as the possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the dra@@ fts would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend for periods which would take into account the means of the bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the respective time to business under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and the request issued by the Committee for Trade Neg@@ oti@@ ations at its meeting on 11 April and 12 April 1979 , a uniform version of an agreement to carry out Article VII of the General customs and trade agreement must be reached , &quot;
&quot; considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force - I &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
&quot; 2 . acknowledge that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this Convention , envis@@ aged for developing countries , may be insufficient by five years in accordance with Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 in practice for some developing countries . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ iry of the deadline stated in Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 , whereby the contracting parties agree that such an application in cases where the developing country can prove good reasons ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . acknowledge that developing countries which currently carry out customs clearance on the basis of official minimum values , if necessary , want to make a reservation in order to maintain these values for a limited transitional period under conditions and conditions which the contractual parties agree to retain ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . acknowledge that developing countries , who think that revers@@ al of the order of application according to Article 4 may cause actual difficulties , may have the wish to make the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot;
&quot; the government of : ... reserves the right to suggest that the relevant provision of Article 4 shall only be applied , if the customs authorities apply to the application of Article 5 and 6 in reverse order . &quot;

&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , and lamb &quot;
&quot; I honor me to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be fixed to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in battle @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount of the annual quantity did not exceed the agreed amount and / or is executed according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes up the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the community market is not affected in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the goods collected from this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the case of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina am@@ ends the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import restrictions for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 , mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 will be fixed to the community &apos;s total weight of 23 000 tonnes , the day of the accession of Greece to the community . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the Community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat are not under@@ mining the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , only takes place at prices and conditions that are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina warran@@ ts adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular by the fact that , within the quantities specified in this agreement , it is granted export lic@@ ences for the products listed under the number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community itself ple@@ dges to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent upon the submission of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall inform the competent authority of the community at regular intervals the quantities that have been issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may be en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed according to identification land . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; it regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions specified for the objective mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat @-@ meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community . &quot;
the committee discusses all issues arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount , set under number 2 , is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 . &quot;
&quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until January 1 of the following year will be fixed in proportion to the total annual amount , taking into account the seasonal character of trade . &quot;

&quot; agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &quot;
&quot; I honor me to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential in the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that it must be ensured that the normal sale of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not impaired in these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cooled ram , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will ensure access to the community &apos;s market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb &apos;s meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the set quantity did not exceed the set amount in fact . &quot;
the pre @-@ set amounts are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes up the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the goods collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand alters the quantities stated in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trading with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import restrictions for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ ech@@ less rate mentioned in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total volume mentioned in clause 2 will be fixed on the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand hammer and lamb meat in the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community announces that the sales of frozen meat are not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake anything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without risk of market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Community is obliged to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent local authority of the competent authority of the community is informed at regular intervals the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed according to identification land . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the committee regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goats should be carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the committee discusses all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties as part of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount stated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the quantity , which is reached by the entry into force of this agreement , will be fixed in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand as well as for New Zealand &apos;s main area on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties prior to 1 April 1984 . &quot;

&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood tests , containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ated to the antibody or any other substance on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ äm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium through repeated th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated only by the volume of the flow of blood in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time of standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ists , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow . &quot;
&quot; the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge by the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ oric form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0,5 % of its weight , if it is tested by further drying through phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain either sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange for blood group determination shall not be d@@ yed arti@@ ficially as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity contained in a container must be so large that , if necessary , the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group identification .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents that are given are to be kept from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch will no longer be used .
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; every single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for recovery , &quot;

these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and must not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies need to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ eg@@ y antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB , including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not human red blood cells that contain no A tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison list , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is bl@@ ended on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flow of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood type B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not human red blood cells that contain no B tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison , with an in@@ und@@ ulation of blood cells belonging to group B to Tit@@ le ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flow of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood type they belong to . &quot;

&quot; the Parties to the European Convention on 14 May 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; &quot; ) - &quot;
&quot; based on article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , according to which &quot; the Parties shall meet all the necessary measures &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties of human origin from all input taxes ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this liberation falls into the jurisdiction of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it was established , which has the necessary powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from that point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the convention without becoming the contracting party of the supplementary protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the member states of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community of any acceptance or objection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General notes the European Economic Community either any action , Noti@@ fication or Noti@@ fication concerning this Convention . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community as well as from the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the border policies and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , a uniform management document will be introduced in the joint @-@ Community goods traffic from January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the event that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administrative document , &quot;
&quot; in the event that this Convention may not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the contractual parties from its obligations arising from other international agreements , &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administrative paper ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Shipping &quot; &quot; ) is to be used for all export and import processes , as well as for a common shipping method that is referred to in the goods traffic between the contracting parties . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ esters related to the goods transport between the contractual parties are fu@@ eled by a single document , which is to be used for the pattern in Anne@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the paper paper serves as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - expressly requested for the implementation of legal provisions applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the single application document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties involved , so that they may be able to arrive at the request of an advantage or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contractual parties from applying simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be set at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration can be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a registration , in which the competent authorities consent to a periodi@@ c collective notification , must be submitted within the deadline stated by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed instead of using commercial paper . &quot;
&quot; if the security paper is used , the parties concerned with the consent of the competent authorities may include all the necessary for@@ geri@@ es related to export and import@@ ation instead of the supplementary sheets to the paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the for@@ esters for their entire goods transport or for sub @-@ areas ;
&quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments , which include several types of goods , for the provision of the transport charges in the shipping method loading lists rather than the supplementary sheets for the deposit paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow registration , if necessary , be created by public or private data processing facilities according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , if necessary , without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; to allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of applications , that the export , shipping or import alert is either generated by the single paper station@@ ery created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply facil@@ itation , adopted by the Joint Committee in the way of a resolution pursuant to article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the provisions required for export , shipping and import@@ ation of goods required by the issu@@ er are placed in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre@@ text mentioned in the App@@ endi@@ x I , are to be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) The registration shall be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties approved by the competent authorities of the country in which the responsibility for the export or shipping will be met .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of identification or the transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Not@@ withstanding Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 , registration shall always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country if they are registered in this country by other than the copies submitted by the customs office of the export or country country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the filing copies required for each individual proced@@ ural session between the contracting parties , which may , if necessary , be added to the copies required for the establishment of the for@@ esters in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the relevant authorities may , however , show that the provisions for the export and the shipping process are based on one and the same pressure by means of the copies planned for these for@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall convince themselves as far as possible that the information contained in the specimens contained in the individual process sections shall be consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure smooth goods traffic between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The Administr@@ ative Committee may be completely or partially refused or rejected , if the requested country of view is that the Administr@@ ative Council would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification for the search@@ able land shall be disclosed . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which it could not afford , if it is requested , it points out in its search for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained in paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection granted to the country &apos;s domestic law , which it has received , for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which it has issued and may otherwise be used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) A mixture committee is used , in which each contracting party is represented by this convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) The Joint Committee shall appoint a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , among other things , gover@@ ns the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the president and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The Joint Committee may use sub@@ committees and working groups , which support him in his tasks . &quot;
( 1 ) The Joint Committee shall have the task of managing this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; to do so , the committee is regularly informed of the practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; it speaks recommendations and in cases according to paragraph 3 resolutions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Joint Committee resol@@ ves changes in annex@@ es to this Convention , as well as the explanations mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a party party in the Joint Committee has adopted a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; every contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this agreement , taking into account the need to reduce the burden of goods carrying goods traffic as far as possible and to provide satisfactory solutions to the difficulties arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand as well as for the territories of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention also applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union contract .
&quot; every contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention in compliance with a 12 @-@ month period ; the written notice is to be addressed to the de@@ posit@@ ary mentioned in Article 17 , which it notes to all other contractual parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention will enter into force on 1 January 1988 , provided the contractual parties have deposited their acceptance certificates to the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it will enter into force on the first day of the second month after the final certificate of acceptance . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in a tran@@ script in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish , Swedish , Swedish , Swedish , Portuguese , Swedish , Swedish , Portuguese , Swedish , Portuguese , Swedish , and Spanish . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will respond as far as possible to this request . &quot;
&quot; 2 . faced with the Commission &apos;s responsibility in matters relating to the management of fish stocks , the Council cons@@ ents to present all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the status quo and the reports of its Advisory Committee on fisheries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how cooperation between the two parties is intensified , and in particular examining the possibilities offered by the Commission to establish a closer link to the Council &apos;s Advisory Committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . in the event of signing this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 D@@ KR and then make annual payments . &quot;
the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings conven@@ ed on special request by the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement shall be extended on the basis of the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; every party has the possibility at all times to withdraw from the agreement , subject to compliance with a one @-@ year period of notice . &quot;
&quot; in terms of clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission to monitor observer status in meetings of the Advisory Committee on fisheries management of the Council . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the Commission &apos;s representative would have the right to ask and participate in meetings , but would not have any right to vote and also not have the opportunity to change the agen@@ das of the sessions . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me whether these agreements are acceptable as the basis of a co @-@ operation between your council and the community for you .
I assume that this letter and your answer are the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .

&quot; the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the field of customs duties , &quot;
&quot; in the de@@ fle@@ ction that it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of the goods entered into force on June 14 , 1983 , entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the de@@ fle@@ ction , that without a change in Article 13 of the stated Convention , the time of the entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain uns@@ af@@ e - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Con@@ ventions , &quot; paragraph 1 will receive the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January , which shall be followed immediately after exp@@ iry of at least three months immediately , at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons signed in Article 11 without reservation of rati@@ fication or deposited their rati@@ fication or accession certificates , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A.

&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and conservation of soils , but also allows the use of land that does not allow any other planting , and that itself with extensive management , which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , favour@@ ably responds to any improvement of the cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that from its cultivation the existence and the standard of living of millions of families depend entirely on the measures taken to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producing countries themselves and in non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table olive oil are essential raw materials in the areas in which olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer income ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that this causes all special difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policies of economic growth in the countries that lie in zones where olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , especially the olive growing countries in development , is added ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , given the special circumstances of olive growing and the market for olive products , the measures required must go beyond the national sphere and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
