&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Panel Study ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Tru@@ cking thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have alternating periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat medium to heavy man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or using the processed tablets in patients with the difficulty of swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neur@@ ons to each other . &quot;
ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , has a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies for up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which led to increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution to absorb ( pick up ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater decrease in the symptoms than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; also more effective than placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses decreased the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , nausea , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ activity disorder ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicates a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ( 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regarding worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the shared gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ a@@ 4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be given with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be applied during pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l reduced overall incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study for over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study for over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ file . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions Rate Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ surgery in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits that partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels over 2 weeks , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy@@ sion of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination rule is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ iz@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in test subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ related non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average current @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contained in the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg are no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for dispens@@ ing individual boxes made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment .
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
27 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment .
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment . &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulties with swal@@ lowing of Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the processed tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases reported after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical trials . &quot;
patients who have difficulties with swal@@ lowing of Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the processed tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio@@ availability study .

&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ections solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle while circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given according to the individual clinical status considering the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ or@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ activity disorder ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regarding worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ al@@ ation was greater compared to the one @-@ time dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ time indication intra@@ muscular and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ a@@ 4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received the intensity of the se@@ al@@ ation greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study for more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was compared with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ denti@@ ality and behavi@@ our@@ al problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in terms of ap@@ titude and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ad reference arm . &quot;
&quot; mean recovery from the initial value to the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of study in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15 @-@ 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbit ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for security treatment , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no significance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters of earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; considering only those who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding , or at the beginning of treatment , low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Abra@@ x@@ ane Group in the entire European Union to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited Company . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is interrupted until bet@@ ter@@ ment is achieved in degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could exhibit substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phy count rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been demonstrated , cardiac inf@@ estation in the indicated patient population is not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating remedies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child to bear . &quot;
male patients should consult a sperm count prior to treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane provides the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; the following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events , which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , loose stool , loose stool , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , muscle pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ m@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their disposal oly@@ mer .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umen receptor and performs pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( allo@@ yed protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive First @-@ Line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the exposure to active agents ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arized distribution and / or soft tissue connection of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients from this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when using Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile injection , the sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute to a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution . &quot;
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot;
&quot; then , the through@@ flow bottle should be slowly and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset is made of the powder . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or sin@@ king substances are visible , the through@@ flow bottle must be inver@@ ted gently to achieve complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to application . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml @-@ suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer if other therapies have been tried but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane must not be applied : if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other ingredients of Abra@@ x@@ ane • if you are breast@@ feeding • If your white blood cells are degra@@ ded ( starting values for neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about this )
&quot; special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a impaired kidney function • If you suffer from num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • If you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane using other medicines , please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently used them , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs , as these may possibly cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , before treatment , they should be advised of a sperm preservation treatment , as the use of the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment is the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane machines can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; if you receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the water bottle up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) when stored in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; each bottle contains 100 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After re@@ constitution , each ml of the Sus@@ pension contains 5 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other ingredient is alb@@ um@@ ulation of man ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when using Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ through bottle .
&quot; then slowly and carefully swing the bottle for at least 2 minutes , and / or in@@ vert it until a complete reset is made of the powder . &quot;
&quot; calculate the exact total dose of 5 mg / ml of Sus@@ pension for the patient and in@@ ject the appropriate amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
par@@ enter@@ al drugs should be subjected to any particles and disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ ation prior to applying a visual inspection whenever the solution or the container allow this .
stability un@@ opened pier@@ cing bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date indicated on the packaging when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the box to protect the contents from light .
&quot; stability of the re@@ constituted suspension in the through@@ feed bottle After the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for the placing of the market provides the medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials prior to the market launch :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient are provided . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels , where there may be complications in the context of blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood donation before the intervention and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; when administered as an injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to the refer@@ ral drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the onset of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study involving the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed on skin spra@@ yed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;

&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and is the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operating procedures requiring a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large @-@ scale elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no lack of iron , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pedi@@ atric patients with the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
&quot; the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease . &quot;
&quot; given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count towards ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have risen compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ co@@ cy@@ te count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an appeal to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg on each 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under treatment should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or underlying disease in patients who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ rot or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of active effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes for failure ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ te index ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the use of epo@@ et@@ ine when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered for a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ Adju@@ st@@ ment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist in case of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial out@@ put@@ range of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not shown to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was achieved in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy .
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the growing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no evidence of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .

the most common adverse effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ or can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the physi@@ ologically acquired epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ yl@@ ated and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a slightly unclear , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
there is no stimulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with nearly the 20@@ x of the weekly recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa leads to reduced fö@@ ts@@ hip body weight , a dela@@ ying of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation . &quot;

your doctor may carry out regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account before starting the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; very seldom has been reported about the occurrence of an an@@ em@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break off your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed for adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood @-@ drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed may act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumor neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you are ahead of a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated appropriately before the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia affects the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are well set , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and make sure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attack , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary flow disturbances of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;
&quot; ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see the section called &quot; Speci@@ fic At@@ tention in the Use of Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may occur - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood @-@ drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial h@@ edge is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones become br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered from a minor trau@@ matic her@@ nia , as with the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of ap@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ et@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of up to five years .
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the placebo . &quot;
compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
cla@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients where the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company for the marketing of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ den@@ cation of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is required &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of ap@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people of A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of ap@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) . &quot;
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are reported in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with ren@@ al function disorders that referred to as a decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis between the a@@ cla@@ sta@@ sis and the placebo group over three years .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with a@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with ap@@ cla@@ sta in the patients &quot; disease . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was performed , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot;
&quot; in 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis occurred in the jaw area of a patient with an ap@@ cla@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients from 75 years old and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; the effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally permanent effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % increase in the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the hip joint by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge were taken . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ ct ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo and the retention of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 in intervals during study duration . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment at all times .
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % of the total amount and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone atri@@ cian was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.0 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma cruci@@ ble rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a prolonged period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearances from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimin@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β ) represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; a decreased clearance of met@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which adequately exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum @-@ calcium level . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk Management Plan The owner of the authorisation for the marketing application comm@@ its itself to conduct the studies and additional activities on the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which is explained in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the approval application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby restoring normal bone formation and giving strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drink , worry that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before stopping the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you consider the completion of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion very often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received a@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling sensation , di@@ zz@@ iness , diar@@ rho@@ ea , headache , swelling , swelling , swelling , swelling , it@@ ching , skin rash , swelling , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recently , it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recently , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended in front of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive means for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on the adjustment of smoking , on the other hand , showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he found the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tissue . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and may cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is required while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
it is additional to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) which also have one or more risk factors ng like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of absence of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no noticeable risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms appear .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

obes@@ e patients as well as in patients with obesity have studied and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ability study in which a limited number of people were administered by up to 300 mg .
the patients had BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an simultaneously existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6,5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 weight reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ 20 mg , an average waste of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( starting value tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;

&quot; influence of food : he subjects , who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in wet state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , had a 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x or by 48 % increased ng AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin color may have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients with other ethnic populations .
n popularity @-@ pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse events , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Panel Study ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be applied to patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the acet@@ one treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ gia was studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either acet@@ one or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trial , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea fell by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo was reduced by 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving acet@@ one in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated initial liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme parameters are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued , should be conducted prior to the clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by adi@@ pose deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral double or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is to be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on drug interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby less@@ ens the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tumour and the index of refra@@ ction of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were carried out in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures oc@@ cured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have activated activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by activating specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose disposal in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for one year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while decreased values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rom@@ atic disease were random@@ ized into groups receiving either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma , usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in fa@@ ec@@ es ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induced increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies more than 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents in comparison to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both of an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study presented the objective with regard to its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered as strongly as with another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package leaf@@ let ) . &quot;
the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes in comparison to the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually once or twice daily applied when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change concerning starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients with medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 B@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o . &quot;

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a well @-@ known help person or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum duration is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the administration point - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;

clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % decrease in mortality ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) was reduced by intraven@@ ously given ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum duration is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours , and the total duration of activity is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
&quot; the data is limited , but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;

this can happen : • If you in@@ ject too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal
&quot; let your Nov@@ o@@ Get@@ pens cap be closed , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
• Rem@@ ove the rubber compound with a medical cloth • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap just and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let ( figure A ) • P@@ ull the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a couple of times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
&quot; while air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge • While you continue to hold the injection needle , turn the cartridge back in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • While the injection needle continues to show upwards , press the push button quite in ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now you have to leave the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin . &quot;
&quot; • Place the cap again on the pen , that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outward , while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; note the highest number you can see on the pressure dial • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap simply for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
rotate it until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel resistance - then take the cap off and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the push @-@ button pressed completely until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .
&quot; it may be in@@ accurate • You can &apos;t set any dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to adjust your dose or select . &quot;

&quot; if one of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information , please inform your doctor , your diabe@@ tic couns@@ ellor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; always set the cap of your Flex@@ Pen ready @-@ to @-@ use pens , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
&quot; F Ke@@ ep the Flex@@ Pen at the top of the cartridge and kno@@ ck it slightly against the cartridge for a couple of times , so that existing air bubbles accumulate in the cartridge at the top . &quot;
the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards by turning the dose selection knob in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is over the dose indication .
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who are already showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zed deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; , &quot; i.e. larger specimen deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take more medicines at least during the first six months under the treatment of aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea , nausea , rash and abnormal liver function . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present g@@ no@@ d@@ ules and / or rheum@@ arthritis ) .
&quot; if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sa@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or heart failure , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ astic medicines , acute rheum@@ atism may occur during the course of treatment , because the reduction of serum levels in serum levels can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ oid treatment and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in tin was done no exchange rate studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen n@@ apro@@ x 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; in a study with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a potential weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ d@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de contains the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a 32 % drop in C@@ MA@@ x , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the test far@@ ts was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ oid group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ onic , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin lesi@@ ons , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in level of potassium in blood , decrease of the number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , the efficacy of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises in the context of the reaction sc@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cancer value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the treatment .
&quot; in 50@@ 9 patients , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 times a day ; 10 patients with serum cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were received 100 mg 1 times daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data from the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out in the months ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in g@@ ossi@@ p size , which resulted in 54 % of patients complete dis@@ appearances until month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ L / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional after administration . &quot;
&quot; for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration levels was observed , provided that was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma connection of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the urine was found in the urine as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of p / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ of 0.5 g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not vary significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ met@@ ered treated group , at approximately 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.1 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a reduction in expenditure and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies of bearing rats with ex@@ positions , such as the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and the bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not produce ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that indicates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ le@@ gia ( digestive disorders ) , de@@ con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( blo@@ ating disorders ) , beaten abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic digestion . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only charged with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of p@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; for example , pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ ies , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore advised to pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to consult the medicine in case of symptoms of p@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or a new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe R@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the onset of symptoms that indicate a malign@@ ant irritation , continue to take . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was identified , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and complications , were rare ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contains predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a surgical intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical trials was jointly taken with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy or fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was reported also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um calcium intake of up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ order of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin through UV light via the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cytes into vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al elimination of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures of oste@@ opor@@ otic people . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 hydro@@ xy@@ lic vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) for 15 weeks compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) . &quot;
studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic equilibrium of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo ) was reached in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the growth of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) was taken : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ aded to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses of between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) showed no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and , therefore , it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion With the administration of radio@@ actively marked Vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the mean elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % , in the fa@@ ec@@ es after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly through urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients , who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver , in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year ( for example , by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and studied how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors , headaches , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of the blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Advent , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the pale yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule part with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be checked before change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low level , was comparable to both ni@@ otic and transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night &apos;s transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearing substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted by a gra@@ ft receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are switched to adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ fts , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal cancer patients , arrived at an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in pancre@@ atic patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; dose adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood age mirrors in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction . &quot;
kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , be careful ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations for the tal@@ low level in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low controls .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age Adju@@ st@@ ment , Chan@@ ges of the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or at the same time using substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus general blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with low clearance , adjustments of the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the level of seb@@ um in the blood is not exceeding 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first period after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t patients , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus below or above exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was found . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was found . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advent ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a tumor or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy could be observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can show symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are recommended in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal contra@@ ction .
&quot; highly do@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lowers the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended to potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the adverse effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not observed precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

cases of anti @-@ virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma rot@@ eins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; effect mechanism and pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ depend@@ ant inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; 175 patients enrolled in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t , in 6@@ 30 cases after a col@@ on transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , which received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , 2@@ 1,7 % of cases occurred in the development of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection came , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients , who received a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , which received a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired tal@@ low level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; color@@ ectal transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to tal@@ lies between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recent gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly carried out via the bile . &quot;
&quot; the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f , in stable patients ( once daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was found . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

&quot; advances are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of Factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A are suffering from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ant is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar but is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions was examined . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cells was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any other component . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following here@@ tical events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in response to factor VI@@ II , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled by an adequate dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should follow the patient &apos;s condition , and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk depends on the greatest risk within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ posi@@ tional days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters originate from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients same or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which is required to submit P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for further extension proceedings in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially to withdraw its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that links and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and therefore no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in brings benefits to patients in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ bi @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are subsi@@ dis@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aero@@ bic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines used to treat allergies ) cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from a con@@ tra @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiovascular disease , hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ ton@@ ia ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ ton@@ ia ) , or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the placing of aviation in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , cr@@ ushing or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the end of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be oral or nas@@ al as a swelling of the Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treating patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze must stop at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , were not observed clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded altogether . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies revealed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
because reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impairment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mag@@ ma cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine mon@@ otherapy over the 2 week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes following the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ ying gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio equivalent was to exposure after the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not be recognized by any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application , pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ate allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleeping disorders , muscle pain , var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation , and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver damage has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tray ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is contained in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two trials of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by determining the variation of the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , impairment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body util@@ ises the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any other ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms end and can be resum@@ ed again .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effects of alcohol were not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that it may occur in very rare cases , which may result in impairment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mag@@ ma cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified as an alternative to the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology of the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; as hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all the ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
&quot; an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded altogether . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed a comparable degree of exposure to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer be identified . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data to support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be metabol@@ ised , is identical to that with children that are normal metabol@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ som@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effects of alcohol were not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily des@@ lor@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor activity . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in increased drow@@ sin@@ ess or increased drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are severely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active agent cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded altogether . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III brake bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene closures with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for inser@@ ting with scal@@ ings of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to intake once a day in the mouth , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including strengthening subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the processed tablet is removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed enam@@ el tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical trial was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including strengthening subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and below bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in individual dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in individual dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of the pre @-@ clinical and clinical exercise tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be metabol@@ ised , is identical to that in children who are normal metabol@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of the adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most frequent side effects reported more often than placebo had diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a one @-@ dose dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 . &quot;
&quot; at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see below 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially to withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s marketing for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine has been administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and form antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to make contact with a flu virus of this stem fast antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , a@@ dep@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot;
it should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , a@@ dep@@ ase reduces the HIV levels in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ gregation has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the drug induced with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r has been compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who previously had prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml in 48 weeks compared to placebo , but chor@@ oidal atro@@ phy was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , the viral load decreased , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few in response to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ esters inhibit@@ ors , the drug induced by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a greater de@@ bris of the viral load along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of ather@@ os@@ clerosis ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 As@@ sets may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ acy may not be applied to patients , St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded as well as ag@@ gregation and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children treated over four years compared to the risks out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; ag@@ gregation is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ dep@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ ms is not proven . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gen@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was given at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ acy across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ gregation is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
&quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ eal capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ cu@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying add @-@ on of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of a@@ dep@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ cri@@ ption is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ ther@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ gregation must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of a@@ dep@@ ase and k@@ est@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of am@@ ate@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods of determination of the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , a@@ dep@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ ium extract symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl g@@ utter content of the as@@ gener@@ a solution to intake , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
it should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or ex@@ foli@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses associated with the treatment of medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ tens are present . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections may develop at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial et@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width a@@ dep@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gro@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus and , if possible , check the virus load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; up to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the in@@ viol@@ ating component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ a are located at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ virus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as an exact predic@@ tive effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ virus . &quot;
the concur@@ rent administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ dep@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could increase the plasma levels of both drugs in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ NI ) once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with ap@@ eri@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ dep@@ ase because it can cause resor@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@
&quot; concur@@ rent use with as@@ gener@@ acy can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous use of a@@ dep@@ ase with k@@ est@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level at the same time are expected to be expected . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with concur@@ rent addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ ther@@ ase should not be applied together with an or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ ium extract symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ gregation , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of additional ad@@ minist@@ ering Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended concur@@ r@@ ently with ap@@ eri@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the ap@@ hor@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , advanced early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with taking ap@@ eri@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg as@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients as well as under the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cc@@ ally fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ cks ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ule nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , who received 600 mg of as@@ par@@ ase twice a day together with low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which were given in patients who received as@@ gener@@ acy along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ cal stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the 13 of 14 children , in which a virus failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns may be subject to alterations by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these genes associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients who said a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and other isol@@ ates ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly used with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred three @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of untreated as@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ Gen@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration when using PI pre@@ treated children as expected . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake imp@@ acted the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 have to be administered with caution when given with care at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ compatible than from the capsules ; therefore a@@ dep@@ ase solution and a@@ anno@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ base .
&quot; even if the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ est@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas appeared in male animals , which were the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been revealed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymph@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ep@@ atic toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ap@@ eri@@ ase or after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ cu@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying add @-@ on of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of a@@ dep@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods of determination of the drug concentration are available . &quot;
it should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; up to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached twice a day in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as an exact predic@@ tive effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ virus . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin ,
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ gregation , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration when using PI pre@@ treated children as expected . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 have to be administered with caution when given with care at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas appeared in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been revealed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymph@@ oma . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; as a combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to take in was not covered in patients with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI previously treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dos@@ er recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ a solution to intake and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl g@@ utter content , as@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) are available methods of determination of the drug concentration . &quot;
it should be set to duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ tens are present . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; up to 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; concur@@ rent use with as@@ gener@@ acy can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 different C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l may not be applied during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with taking ap@@ eri@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
the early departure of a delayed 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; unconscious &quot; ap@@ eri@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large Vet@@ eg@@ ulation volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been revealed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses k@@ est@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ap@@ eri@@ ase .
the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have read the information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before the beginning of treatment . &quot;
&quot; similarly , there is no sufficient information to recommend using A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to improve the effect of children aged 4 to 12 , or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; In the case of taking ap@@ eri@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking ap@@ eri@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; - In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;
&quot; if you are using certain medicines that may lead to serious side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as ap@@ eri@@ ase , your doctor may carry out additional blood tests to minimize possible safety issues . &quot;
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should breast@@ feed their children under no circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
traffic jam and the operation of machines There have been no studies on the influence of ap@@ eri@@ ase on the air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machines .
please take this medication after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , it is advisable that you take this for more than one hour before or after ap@@ eri@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ag@@ gregation may be reduced . &quot;
dose of A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; 85 As much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of ap@@ eri@@ ase when you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking the intake as before . &quot;
&quot; in treating an HIV infection , it is not always possible to say whether any occurring side effects are caused by ap@@ eri@@ ase , by other medicines which are taken at the same time , or by the HIV infection itself . &quot;

dose of A@@ cu@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; therefore , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken greater amounts of ap@@ eri@@ ase than you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; &quot; solution for taking up was not proven in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum flavour , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo formed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients . • Results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream can continue until all visible anus @-@ war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot;
there should be a weighing up between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing up between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with a line leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation might have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine Cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ators applied to the treatment of external tendencies in the genital and peripheral area , no clinical experiences have been present so far . &quot;
&quot; although limited data suggest an increased rate of dietary supplements in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during the therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed following the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as there are currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the use in pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p are available .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity in the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ off nor after multiple topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and considered likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream in the related side effects include complaints at the site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably , or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the review , the clinical evidence presented according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it is common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review , the clinical evidence presented according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often severe Er@@ y@@ themed ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ f formation and ruin ( 19 % ) came . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ adver@@ tent one @-@ time or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; with 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , the patients were completely healed ; this was in case of 20 % of the 105 patients who had treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine versus 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks per week was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that also remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ial ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and 8 mg , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study , which points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin . &quot;
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for four months for the der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on cancer carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with the diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) do not break down and accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , difficult movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with recovery equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines before the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be well @-@ known and necessary to update this summary . &quot;
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with a certain diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in individual steps .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years have not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the Phase 3 clinical trial , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are often observed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , patients were treated for a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months following the beginning of treatment ( mean age of 5 years compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( resp@@ . up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not affected by radio@@ immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who never had access to serum . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ fi@@ ces a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions was typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning for the therapy of enzymes lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ ses of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the vi@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first four weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing , movement area of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosing schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every two weeks may be a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security and toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under the age of 6 . &quot;

&quot; this tab is used for long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you are using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicine that contains chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can gradually be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a other medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
&quot; in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a single therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a loss of fluids ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from spreading .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the all@@ otted appointment of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta had longer survival compared to the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with a sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) with a sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the through@@ flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with thor@@ ac@@ ic advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and in the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third payment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each gift , including differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the na@@ di@@ rs of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Deg@@ ree 2 Blood .
&quot; if patients should not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or above , in comparison to patients aged 65 years old , an increased side effect risk exists . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the recommended dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients have to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es have reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the number of plat@@ el@@ ets has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ pal@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees of 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was pre@@ heated when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment conditional toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion to the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ f@@ ell@@ ular space . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in advance of the treatment plan to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised to apply high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed are avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy unless it is essential and , after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .

&quot; in clinical trials , patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes le@@ thal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , occasional cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple attacking points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ al syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ form my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ cop@@ per@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ center , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder to produce a concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy , in the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another drug for the treatment of cancer . &quot;
&quot; if you have kidney disease or previous one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , since you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
you will be able to perform blood tests before each in@@ fusion ; it checks if your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or break the treatment unless it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
&quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you receive the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin gift . &quot;
&quot; if you have a liquid collection around the lungs , your doctor may choose to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to receive a child during treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you take medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as medicines called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned da@@ - tion of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your ren@@ al function , your doctor will tell you what other drugs you can take and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; a hospital pharmac@@ ist , the nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with sterile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be Kor@@ ti@@ son tablets ( according to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son two times a day ) , which you must take the day before , during and on the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) , or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA a day . &quot;

&quot; it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take allergies and do not receive weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they may not break down some fats in the diet , thereby causing approximately one quarter of the fats that fed with the food di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg showed an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ edge , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tion , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or on chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and for pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; allergy is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older persons and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption Syndrome • Early Treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic drug may be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
&quot; when using War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size . &quot;
&quot; † It &apos;s plau@@ sible , that treatment with all@@ i can lead to treatment with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered on normal overweight and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect relies on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rem@@ nants of the ga@@ str@@ isch and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric acid @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study involving obes@@ e patients , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial neighbor , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
keep out of the reach of children . keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; a permanent weight loss , for instance by improving diet and exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to each day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories you use is given below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by observing the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while decreasing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously . &quot;
this reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ ory and fat goals and to keep them . • Sinn@@ voll is a nutrition diary with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed calories and fat du@@ cks and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the addition of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an ant@@ etic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the color@@ ectal cancer , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ struction or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days following chemotherapy for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ duc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ mon@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average term half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ of g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) met@@ ac@@ ron plasma concentration measured between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved once daily with intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ mon@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ances 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination of the liver and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of action .
&quot; high doses pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this authorisation for the marketing authorisation must inform the European Commission about the plans for the marketing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval for the marketing of the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) is inserted , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of the reference drug was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus were detected in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in the absence of the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than with the reference drug . furthermore , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected layers ( cra@@ cking or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ li@@ lin@@ ent Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ ma may not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients aged nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the surface of the body . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in house tw@@ ins , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were prov@@ able or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections predomin@@ ate against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small cavi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment is stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection started . &quot;
retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved after topical application on poorly bon@@ ded skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on reduced skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding was continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go was to be continued / ended is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most frequently reported adverse effect irritation was the date of performance that concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding sites and prevent normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to respond to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples were taken during the days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200@@ c@@ m2 weakened skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats @-@ micro core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in a up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 weakened skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for the marketing is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional drug ag@@ ility activities in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted to the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; to show irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a ga@@ zelle belt , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure , containing 5 , 10 or 15 gram of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the vacc@@ ination plan can be run out of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three doses existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ dex@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ination , taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a chim@@ ney is desired for hepatitis A and for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ Hepatitis A ) antibodies are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her chim@@ ney as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the absence of det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection substances , for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , containing 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that the administration of other vacc@@ ines can be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , since it can result in bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diet , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tus@@ sis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ ere and preserv@@ ative ino@@ cul@@ ation formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ t@@ ins combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis for calculation per vacc@@ ination dose , but not based on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of Ambi@@ rix , pain was observed at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ing was comparable high ( i.e. across the entire vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , serum @-@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12 to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ative vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the rate of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ olds after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12 to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the fresh@@ ening of a combined diet , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tus@@ sis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ emul@@ sion rates similar to the former formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ dium per eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food@@ stuff and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the moment of the vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching rash or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per ino@@ cul@@ ation dosage ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination intake of this vaccine with reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / its body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / include ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected from one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate spots and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently required that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ ness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite
pal@@ pit@@ ations frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Fo@@ under • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
&quot; other side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or broad strokes that can be it@@ chy or bubble @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye contours and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since the initial approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ y@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with full enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aut is - split on several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal wall ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ y@@ aps may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , pal@@ at@@ ability or taste sa@@ dition , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; am@@ y@@ aps were allowed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information was submitted to this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 lifetime ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) , an indication exists for the use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat via the liver and kidneys is done , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients showed at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cau@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative paths of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a fatigue or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no compla@@ ining effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed prior to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ ol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex came to lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cau@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
&quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment of treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to obtain the medicine using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products which accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out for you , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste disorders , disturbances of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood count ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant der@@ mal odor , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; User to &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; they should be taken or@@ ally with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount of measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with varying thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a certain dosage or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medication for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as c@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators such as He@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox@@ es may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any other component . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had bleeding , as well as with people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angi@@ ox@@ in throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous resolution of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; in case of a PCI being performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a cle@@ vis is administered from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous tigh@@ tening of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight , and an immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bolt @-@ off of angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values , re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed prior to application and intraven@@ ously administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose to be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was used for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tioned he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even though most blood counts of arter@@ ial point @-@ points occur in the case of PCI patients , patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous body intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of IN@@ R value ( International Standard @-@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , abor@@ tion or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tioned He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occurring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
&quot; the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ ob@@ ru@@ din in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organic classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ocular , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in the cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in has slowly split the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with serum induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patient succ@@ eeds in following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were distributed equally over the 3 arms arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox@@ in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide enters into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ use of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , upper th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin lis@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose level and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change in the effectiveness , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to a different type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore alter in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ll@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symp@@ a@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ye and reserves may be weakened or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the un@@ desirable pharmac@@ ies known from clinical trials group@@ ed by system organic classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ c@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ately glu@@ cos@@ al effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data , it was obvious that a comparable post@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; at 2 minutes before the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine was given a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in administered in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the administration of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
