<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Trucking thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have alternating periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to heavy manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or using the processed tablets in patients with the difficulty of swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neurons to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as a "partial agony" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole, like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, has a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their occurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, preventing the recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies for up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which led to increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution to absorb (pick up).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater decrease in the symptoms than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also more effective than placebo, Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses decreased the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (drowsiness), nausea, somnolency (nausea), vomiting, nausea, nausea, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripipzol were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with bipolar-I-disturbance, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripipzol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treating Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hyperactivity disorder), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriated and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicates a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"for this reason, Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with varicose seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to varicose seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"(56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripipzol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripipzol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored regarding worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripipezol on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripizzol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripipezol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripipezol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizing, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripipzol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the shared gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting CYP2D6 or 3a4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be given with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripipzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be applied during pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripipzol reduced overall incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripipzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripipzol was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study for over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study for over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripiprazl and Placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripigezol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the adverse events reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the malign neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripipzol, however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated over the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripipezol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the putfile."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder's response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripizzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- Depressions Rate Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-surgery in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits that partly did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels over 2 weeks, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol found superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripipzol during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxysion of Aripiorl, the N-dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination rule is approximately 75 hours for Aripigezol with extensive metabolizers over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiorl and Dehydro-Aripizole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in test subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripipzol and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for the clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-related non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average current-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"furthermore, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripipezol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole contained in the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg are no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered as strongly as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package leaflet)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Medicinal Products Committee (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes in comparison to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the marketing of Actraphane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually once or twice daily applied when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by an intensified insulin therapy, can perceive hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change concerning starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin, insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin) may cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"when travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients with medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">"4 Bless hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit death in utero."</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or varicose seizures and end with transient or permanent dysfunctions of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Actually - Peripheral Neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful Neuropathy and are normally reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and skin tissue Actually - Lipodystrophy At the injection site a lipodystrophy can arise if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">"general illnesses and complaints at the administration point - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection site)."</seg>
<seg id="885">"diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic edema, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness."</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a well-known help person or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the maximum duration is reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by splitting is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to leave the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not over 25 ° C) before it is resuspended for the first use in accordance with the operating instructions.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerobaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are subsidised."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aeroinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone."</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"after the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EKG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"after intravenous administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average term half-life of approximately 40 hours."</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ of g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) metacron plasma concentration measured between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34%."</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) achieved once daily with intravenous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg was comparable; however the CMAx was higher after one-time dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"about 40% are eliminated through the kidneys, and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palmonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a one-time intravenous injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearances 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination of the liver and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30fold of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"the underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined for one-time use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval for the marketing of the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-like ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of the reference drug was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus were detected in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in the absence of the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease returned to more patients than with the reference drug. furthermore, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected layers (cracking or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillilinent Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alarma may not work against this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be applied in patients aged nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the surface of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in house twins, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were provable or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections predominate against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small cavities, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin ointment, treatment is stopped, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retriapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary wounds, the efficacy of retinapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved after topical application on poorly bonded skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on reduced skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical retinapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding was continued / ended or the therapy with Altargo was to be continued / ended is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo applied, the most frequently reported adverse effect irritation was the date of performance that concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of the ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding sites and prevent normal formation of active 50 ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retinapamulin at at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be targeted by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin towards S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of failure to respond to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and scented skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2709">"metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three doses existing vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambidexrix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults are also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambirix protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients or any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for the basic dimmination with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccination, taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>

<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, need a refresher chimney as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in the absence of detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection substances, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, containing 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value, so that the administration of other vaccines can be required in these cases."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, upper thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or that insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin does not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin lisper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose level and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in the effectiveness, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin needs."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to a different type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore alter in the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyllin, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, sympaolytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethiye and reserves may be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisin enters human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral use."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are the undesirable pharmacies known from clinical trials grouped by system organic classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"if lipodystrophy is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a correspondingly trained person or treated by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m- tus, insulin lulisin showed a disproportionately glucosal effect of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data, it was obvious that a comparable postpranic glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"at 2 minutes before the meal, insulin lulisine was given a better postprandial control than with normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
