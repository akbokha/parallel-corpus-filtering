&quot; to translate the module web page , you will find in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; translate the menu under Extras &apos; web page . select from the drop @-@ down list the source and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated at the point of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; automatic translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not make any important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert into transl@@ ating texts directly . &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Up@@ gra@@ ding ... Open the tab tool@@ box and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of default settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crashes , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module View Fil@@ ters ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras &apos; View Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily identified , can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX Â® command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over the View color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles will occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always adher@@ ed to . it is drawn in order to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will need space , which is then lost to subordin@@ ate entries , if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed space for an entry on the menu item View View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent details to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the picture gallery module can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing skills can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu includes an entry issues or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , please ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; home page to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to learn .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter your path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . &quot;
you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this lets you insert a dot in front of the sub@@ folder name .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw c@@ ams in the Help Menu Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h operations .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nail images can be read out reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even carry out . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ m , above the horizontal dividing line or another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date the album was created first . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you must click the right mouse button on the album and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can group them under a common name . the collection you choose will be used to sort your photos when you choose to sort or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Test@@ ers : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; When album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you must wait briefly while the preview images are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools All preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . which information is this , you can edit the digi@@ code settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the preview images have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse po@@ inter at a moment above a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such help window .
&quot; albums and tags allow you to organize your images as it suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to it . you can select all the functions that are done with &amp; digi@@ r ; you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and edit ... Select a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image editing programs can cause problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turns . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ pack ; delete it , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Data List ; arran@@ ges your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the view view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key word list ; summari@@ ze , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ click either on &amp; quot ; My cue point ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ title of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then , a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to use digi@@ code ; s functionality with keywords , you first need to submit your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch selection . alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select them from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keyword , this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the contex@@ tual menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ el@@ ly adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom panel below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit Search , the search form will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog box will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ pack ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . by using a shell , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move an image from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ plug ; find the suitable pictures . also here you can set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag or zoom out the mouse wheel . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this requires of course that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the below field , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview panel , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and put it there . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is visible . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of images . if you use pairs to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the sections to compare it . now , use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the illuminated table like e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
use Zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in preview mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management examines every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the methods for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , archive , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use no longer a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in opposition to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location , unless you were able to organize several photos on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata to be stored in &amp; digi@@ code in the Settings page of the metadata ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so &amp; digi@@ kam , you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you best start with the evaluation or ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the next work . &quot;
&quot; let us now with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you and place the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; edited ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure interested in how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then start looking at some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , remin@@ ders , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that you have moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with an inscription for itself to work alone . &quot;
&quot; you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your specifications in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the turn of the spatial presentation now drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innum@@ erable and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel by images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ code ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may include titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk defects , plate failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a budget program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to be a miracle for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good capture device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy study &quot;
&quot; some of the errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT can not determine this error . some of the errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the imminent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric appliances do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , this looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause distorted key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware obsol@@ escence , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not each connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; because an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when power failure occurs . some models even allow them to work even further up the current runs . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; lin@@ ux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are disaster @-@ proof . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences in the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs a year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . it is still alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebook and 46 % for desktop systems , while not@@ ebooks have already accounted for 50 % of theft . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; lin@@ ux . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . so , save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or changing the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data despite f@@ use is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync will only copy the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of at least one month and a snapshot of each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , about the period in which you really are interested because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have the scal@@ ability with plans and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may recommend gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open shell format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
&quot; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers capture it before an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that advoc@@ ates fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them into web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; use it , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . in some cameras this may take a while . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; tab Met@@ adata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , vendor remark , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the Met@@ adata page bar from &amp; edited ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; edited by now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , you will of course only download the new images . &quot;
&quot; when you use the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears to select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Album section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete some , you must first select them and delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this over the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you upload photos from different recording locations to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been taken to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the commit , three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the section Standard Auto @-@ identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use a different date format than standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix Phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar metadata , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ code ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case digi@@ code ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection has been completed , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you know where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to launch the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to a different &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed user , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ em@@ ies and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing . you will thus set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; fix if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should include the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; offer quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be edited in &amp; edited ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , using the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse po@@ inter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ escent &amp; quot ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table these settings are not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the TI@@ FF @-@ File option , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly became a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the spot@@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to catch the spot@@ lights , as penet@@ rating white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general don &apos;t satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ order option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the &amp; edited image options . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ watt algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour gra@@ ding correction , as it is performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ code ; information such as the color information of a color space in the other is to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
conduct questions when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ code ; then examines these folders during startup . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which does not contain ink mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your image would be returned from one device again . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately not on Canon &apos;s models . that &apos;s why here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you recognise the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of the available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will then be loaded by &amp; edited ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . &quot;
&quot; for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller j@@ us@@ cs the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on and off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic recognition , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / XP , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it in the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; to delete a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option Chan@@ ges in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the viewer &apos;s welcome screen ; this speeds up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze when starting .
&quot; the setting At start to new photos searches &amp; digi@@ code ; search for the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; edited ; you can select the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture , or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing entry . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; so you may not be part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the Image Processing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most often required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you may want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the button The button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last time . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by selecting Edit Rec@@ ently or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and note C@@ tr@@ l ; Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ larger factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will enter the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or entire sentences . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the album Export Ass@@ ist . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; edited ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin again .
&quot; in the label view , you can enter or paste let@@ tering with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword ( s ) and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; edited ; session applied . &quot;
the keyword @-@ tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the sample tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword Filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Date , keywords and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard any keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off among other settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner come in a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a colour @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should give you links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other image output is by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to install my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to install your monitor , because s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB , then you either need to connect your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ ble Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the brightness values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
&quot; similarly , almost every brightness area produces the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
&quot; enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the wi@@ dest range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed out images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8 bits per colour . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the upper right a hist@@ ogram is shown that changes dynamically once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play a stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and load do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load later .
&quot; the default settings return all the filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles can be used to consult the chapter colour management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can always use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ code ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created if one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image was completed . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; Eff@@ ect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ch@@ force / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ nage correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of slide . more concrete the three slide bars below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into it and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller , to see how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to adjust whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three paint brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output : the output values allow selecting manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input parameters . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the transfer indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the entran@@ ces applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , linear mode usually creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a matching line will be displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the transfer indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window will show you a preview .
&quot; the view of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are shown on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colored first . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the transfer indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the finished image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects , and can simulate daylight scenes at the time of the day . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter light with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and medium sounds while adding a little cold in the s@@ add@@ les . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; using the digi@@ code ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to one image . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the note of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
added with the digi@@ code ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture runs with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a seas@@ oning effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decor@@ ating with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio cuts previously . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image in any place . this is also possible at several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
&quot; using the digi@@ code ; apply tool sten@@ cil , you can lay a template on a picture . &quot;
the image template used in image processing can be used to place sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the templates , just send an email in English to the digi@@ code ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you must place your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after setting the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; the bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ os@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process is combined with minimal differences to a colour point . &quot;
&quot; images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners apply a field of sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to view the rigid sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; however , you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies also the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image sharp@@ ens the tool . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t soft @-@ drawing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ ring image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid plastic fault in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focusing in image editing .
&quot; the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s folding is influenced even very strongly by the remote pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your bl@@ ur is g@@ auss . in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ pleas@@ urable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; even under optimal conditions , it is never possible to remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods for sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regulator fl@@ atten the ir@@ regul@@ arity of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should ensure that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently . &quot;
directions Ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth@@ en &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ ampl@@ itude da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , small angles should also be chosen small . therefore , make sure that small angles create a long term . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to let it out . &quot;
buttons Save as and load do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground , that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur@@ red the image . the area specified by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor fla@@ ws adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing on the front of the filter to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : checks the edge of the filter for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges may appear smo@@ other if it is too high . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method . &quot;
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local bugs which appear in digital , original or later digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
buttons Save as and load do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then re@@ charged .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ dation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were used to reduce an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts performed by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; Light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ room sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ room to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tis@@ ation correction is a tool to correct vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , in particular those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise shar@@ per effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regi@@ men , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the gra@@ vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
digi@@ tis@@ ation ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the second degree coefficient describes the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , fla@@ ws but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree of distortion . with negative values , distortion @-@ like distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the opposite character of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
&quot; bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start . &quot;
&quot; the tone or cushion correction should be performed before any cutting or res@@ izing . best perform this correction first by . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect is obviously the wrong one . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cro@@ pping tool in the Transform@@ ers menu Rem@@ ove from the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects such as front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate an infrared feature of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film @-@ gra@@ ined if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the spot@@ lights .
&quot; this is a simple to use tool to reproduce film gra@@ bs on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , which is the manufacturer of large silver @-@ gra@@ ders for photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker paint@@ brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller chooses the pen size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ code ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter engra@@ ver is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is looked through glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that take centre stage . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos , or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by a random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural to your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
&quot; you can keep the area free of shelves . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . afterwards , when you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ression filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be used in the Transform@@ ers &quot; &quot; Transform@@ ers &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Transform@@ ers &quot; &quot; menu . &quot;
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to blow up the tool . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and drawers are used exactly to that . any st@@ all@@ ure for photo can be stored as text file and then re@@ charged .
&quot; infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can drag the size of the area to be cut by simply dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; below in the dialog box , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the configuration support settings allow you to hide help , so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic spl@@ its are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third pixel rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the gold center provides more fluid relief lines when you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal of achieving good results for your photos . compared to the third angel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden square . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options mirror and vertical can be used to reflect the harmonious divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing and tool free rotation . choose Transform@@ ers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider corner . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed at the top right .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automati@@ cally trimm@@ ing . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation , but note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tigh@@ tening tool is used to move a part of the image to one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sciss@@ ors can be used horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sc@@ aling , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are dependent on your system and , in some cases , by the way these libraries are compiled . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; only shows files in formats to which you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better and smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings .
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw frame format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ With this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page by Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported by : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are frequently saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program , and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in &amp; edited ; their description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
divide vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be customized in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and put it on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag or zoom out the mouse wheel . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this requires of course that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by file . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box Add cur@@ sor under the button color is activated , the color is inserted from the colour chart on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created this way as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;

&quot; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; quot ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graph ; represented )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open graph in &amp; k@@ graph ; in a &amp; quot ; component ;
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these knots )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of the graph@@ s . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ over opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it using the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can let all graph@@ s of your last session open again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one side will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the Rec@@ over shop page gives you the option of setting the behaviour when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or prompt the program every time . &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time a graph is requested .
the seating administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up more possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge cross@@ ings as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular form according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; the command should specify the graph file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before being drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed as long as this is necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse po@@ inter to get more help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program using the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette and the grid net in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot;
&quot; re@@ stores the last undo step . if you do not have a step back , this function is down@@ lighted . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of gray scale .
&quot; do not change the symbol , but put the current drawing color on the color of the point you click on . &quot;
&quot; from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol bars . &quot;
&quot; with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and set one color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparency display . you can also set the size : the car@@ o on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
read the K@@ IP@@ I module and read the tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; if you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears when you can replace the default values duc@@ r@@ he to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not otherwise be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after pressing the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots can be created after selecting in the Import &gt; Screen Photo menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other areas of work , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo administration on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to make photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented following a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is launched for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . to upload , you will need per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . &quot;
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during up@@ loading .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Chang@@ ing the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to execute a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time , so the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have track data from a place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the inter@@ pol@@ ation options and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog is taking the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . choose the region in question and increase it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the three buttons on the right hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder where you have written permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used for quick image display and quick access to his functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG @-@ enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can create the module via Tools MPEG slide show . &quot;
the images you select will then be included in the image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re@@ play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right below . &quot;
&quot; the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is , for example , useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM respectively . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do you expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file which is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not effect any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or to continue using it later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; press preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent . more images can drag on the list of images to be sent and put there .
&quot; after you have launched the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you chose . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the list of images and put them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; to remove images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here .
do not send too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we suggest you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original express data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button C@@ lose you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option shows that the file name of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . you can then cancel it manually using Es@@ c ; Canc@@ el .
&quot; the option to select images by chance ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so , it is not used in the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower screen edge you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry persons , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are shown . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of work . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the image below . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that is located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the picture for the appropriate person in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the picture for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the search function in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description , the labels or descriptions of the images are searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog start the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; launch a demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it out . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print out this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the previ@@ ew@@ ed view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview button ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . &quot;
the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML menu ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described in more detail . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; create a export file that is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information clearly displayed to the viewer . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this will enable those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can scan your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a larger image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , set the different folders and the URL to where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to copy them manually . so the import function , see , right , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already spent a lot of time using the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even happen once . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ file file . these can import others to your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when you copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the Automati@@ cally Cop@@ y Automati@@ cally close to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option on this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import pictures should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ er the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) selecting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images . however , it has been expanded and today your videos are also being taken care of . in many places in this manual you are talking about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are saved and will automatically re @-@ use them in future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Pre@@ ferences k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will be able to explain the different settings .
&quot; on the left you see six different icons , with which you can view settings of previ@@ ew@@ ing and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access to the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in detail how to define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list box above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always try new modules first with the demo database before you apply them to your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; so , for example , if you use the category people , you will get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own images . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you have entered your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to use any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , therefore , that the names used up are moved up , the people find and assign them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image separately , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the Comment dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to one category and place it in order to make it alphabe@@ tically sorted by your categories . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... , which gives you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the remove button or select Edit Select in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , images can also be used without you stored on your hard disk . of course , you have to store the images somewhere , so you can record it in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images showing the right upper corner are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nail images are available for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so you can preview these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back . so if you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the Image menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those you may want to see for others and click on Current View lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and lock the menu entry All out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; you specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu item Pictures blocked , thus removing all the images that you have locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you all have your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . it of course shows the image , but additional all information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box in the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons up and down . you can go to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let it run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus respectively minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . by pressing the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out once again The Plus button is highlighted in the middle of the image and shows the result of zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out are with the plus and minus button .
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the image . at the moment you can preview this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to preview only the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can place a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show in a picture .
&quot; the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in order to exit the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View from the contex@@ tual menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the contex@@ tual menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to adopt these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the tagged view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the tagged view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under an existing view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , take the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map Le@@ aders above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to save a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left pointing arrow in the cham@@ ber@@ ed bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ ed bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with View window arrangement ... you can save a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but makes sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ Ã© pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is increasingly divided and adap@@ tively because the depth of recur@@ sion depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued further and further sub@@ divided . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the import menu item Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; not yet the full command sum of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; import , write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle in the view field in the camera view and in the window type license plates .
&quot; you can set the object length of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the detail step separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you tick high detail faith@@ fulness for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick on edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold . more details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field Standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map view along with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ rep@@ j@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene then select Edit Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera , which shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the Apply button or the button button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ ress Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the layer expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to the drill a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment is now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ mentation yet . therefore , always remember that you can review the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then go preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should be done easily , as you should have already understood the basic approach of &amp; k@@ rep@@ o mod@@ eler . the ball can be created just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor to one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can get more interesting effects if you take the time to set up some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection have already shown some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even when metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog generate . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ modules ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have saved the model , it will be saved by the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeat the last command , which is most recently revers@@ ed . you can only select this menu item if you have used Edit Rec@@ ently . &quot;
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; , here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to change commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modules ; add and remove commands .
&quot; a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to present rough surfaces without having to shape any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set the short@@ cuts for the respective window in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; also closed when no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image processing based on the digi@@ code ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing to his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will report a page to report problems and requests . all the information you need is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ room ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ down ; . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the Beli@@ ef In@@ dic@@ ators range , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should show in contrast . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images , which no longer makes it possible to scan and save images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer be sc@@ anned and saved as images . &amp; # l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image , or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of the scanner . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; # l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the dialog box of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you do not select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; # l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Clear starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; ou@@ triggers ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; ou@@ trigger .

&quot; for the global short@@ cuts , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up short commands ... Select . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard fit for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error terror = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow to execute external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure tells the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script itself must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signal that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece should be asked ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item can be identified . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script par@@ c@@ els with the extension amar@@ ov@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than going through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and Quick Find will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to type the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you shouldn &apos;t have trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section . &quot;
&quot; de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you can choose between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several map cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ le support . the option switches to the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ le support , thus changing the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ le / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save Play@@ list when moving , saves the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / off to keep the running piece in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing parts to the context browser , automatically switch the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s Ap@@ pear@@ ance section . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can select the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by selecting your own type@@ faces , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the color selection activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume play at startup causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen @-@ Display sub@@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; the option screen is designed for X@@ ab@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear . &quot;
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate further setting options in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , both the selected and their sub@@ folders to search for music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation is necessary in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator , the host will enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is designed to support last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if needed .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace the error will be fixed .
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; file doesn &apos;t exist unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be fixed in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol up to three times until this setting displays its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; most of the installation problems will be solved easily by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in mind if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to rate pieces , the scor@@ ing column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the short@@ com@@ ings Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , next to the Add button , the playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the contex@@ tual menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the actual issue must be what media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input t@@ ass@@ el &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved using a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download mu@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the file register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the default config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the default registry . &quot;
&quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ p d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability name Amar@@ ok player now@@ led@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by clicking on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button initi@@ ates a piece in the queue sequence in the queue . by pressing the button button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tricky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; set the CD , then click the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the valuation for a piece by yourself by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then , by right @-@ clicking on the piece , you can select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the metadata edit dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a defined release plan which is not to be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the General settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click New Design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor &amp; check &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Con@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
&quot; you probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error of G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed alongside G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
&quot; set up Am@@ ok settings ... audio output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter into the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not going to be taken care of . you can of course use this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed car@@ et@@ aker for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection later , or the wizard simply don &apos;t like , this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes you search for certain items . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the Play@@ list window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have checked the option for im@@ porting play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button play . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the Bur@@ n function is also available in the playlist . simply click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have several options to burn a CD here .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . besides , some additional packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; as any regular multimedia player has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection . &quot;
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including creating a collection and a playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later described in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might be noticed that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information shown there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . underneath you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the images may have any name but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display covers images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click anywhere in the sub@@ window with the right mouse button and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it , and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web sites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Artist / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the artist &apos;s artist , and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing artist / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will be displayed first by genre , and among them by artist . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by the artist under the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to the currently valid order .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect .
set ch@@ un@@ ks in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; undo the compilation , change the album marked as a compilation and return to a normal album . after that , the album will not be displayed again under different performers , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is very easy to handle with many play@@ lists , including smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be embedded in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is finished , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and press En@@ ter , you can go to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; when the playlist is longer than in the window space , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down . in this case , holding the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button so long until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for example one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that don &apos;t contain something . &quot;
example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side you will find the Add button , which you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons back and back . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you can see in the player window using the right mouse button . over this menu , you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about play@@ lists . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu lets you by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting promotions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management has received your big entrance in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist appears in the playlist ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ specified ( the details of setting these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ inia ) . this mode requires that you already find some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window , or click the right mouse button on it and then select load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playback directly , and you must add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled until the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New Fil@@ l button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open for editing the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be able to hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed in attention to the settings played . &quot;
&quot; pieces played - this is the number of pieces played , which should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist according to each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want to see . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Inst@@ all scripts by installing the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins are used to enable the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to track the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , remember that when re@@ encoding to MP3 you will receive a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable install of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive . &quot;

&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback there , draw on community help from the forums and get news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least 1 k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and stands in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently loud . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on one entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the file created before will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog store will be displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for every single project file saving .
&quot; when a project has been modified and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then choose between Save and Chan@@ ges . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called File C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are using the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? remedy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you would like to burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to create a DVD copy instead of the normal copy . alternatively , you can also only create one image of a DVD using the copy dialog . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD Â± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for an * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and trimm@@ ing black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the Content View and contain features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content view also allows selecting and dra@@ gging files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the ke@@ yp@@ ad assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ mapping for it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct cre@@ denti@@ als for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way . this dialog is designed for person@@ alization and adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more comfortable K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task will be crucial to which of the programs you prefer . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following at the console : &quot;
next to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have common support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
void copy@@ cat ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ cat ( ) void sm@@ ur@@ l ( ) void sm@@ ur@@ l ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can obtain a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project using K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String , ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void @-@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders that encoding these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses into the mp3 or O@@ GG format , or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ le@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ mer provides a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to circum@@ vent any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , will then explain the daily handling to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet , or can work completely without a network , with everything recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page , step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of CD data starts in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - when a enco@@ der has been configured in the Code tab in the setup dialog - encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as logs , pi@@ es ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the title to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , upload the information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : with that the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; those who want to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must first be installed , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; after installation of a coding , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg . l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and reading rights on it and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something inside by using the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for every read &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is transferred to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is often a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the tab &quot; &quot; General Settings . &quot; &quot; here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only for incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; automatically download data via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ;
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to download the database before . however , if you use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD is supposed to get ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will work first . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send &amp; CD ; transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
&quot; simultaneous reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
CD ; ej@@ ection of the last piece : check this at the &amp; CD ; throw out at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later revision of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; since we use a CD ; we don &apos;t use it in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data obtained for one &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b . so you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually insert data instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet happened , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , search the questions and answers in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but retrieve the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : CD Editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment box can be used for individual comments by line , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help tab for more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the missing CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ; &quot;
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or select the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking the button selection of the reading process , so this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; when you get to know CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it is supposed to continue from this blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , may it . at least until after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these details , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player by &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de systems . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed key on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; drag windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the record play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played back one after the other . ) &quot;
&quot; when playing a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , there is a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics of lyrics and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select Settings text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section stands you how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find these in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the Add @-@ in button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Auto Add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that remain open . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu order sequence of the main collections , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; C@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI Map is a text file , which stores all the required settings for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . but prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; The name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
&quot; in this section , you will see how General MIDI patches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , you can enter the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; Key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds to the percussion channel , for example , take a look at the provided key maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must of course continue to be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that will change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio shows in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole set of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the channel view menu : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files separately . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have open on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop an &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI Files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly that a MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you send me a postcard or MIDI file , you should contact me , since I may already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ inn@@ ed completely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to point out that I only do more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also goes to Jose Luis San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that only displays when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked record . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / can be changed by an editor , and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the playlist with the playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ G ; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer is visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ e ype . here is an example of how a flash &apos; is played with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME players ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can play the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as utility provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or S@@ ME Player ; is used in a console application and searches for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is always taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually alter@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be identified ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as a user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is important to make sure / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a compilation of &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to go back to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; lin@@ ux distribution . the documentation of the distribution and installation CD / DVD should be used for the installation .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact about the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or if you are comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , please refer to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; box ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to find out more about the book and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book for this . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Ass@@ ist from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
coding : this will set the character encoding . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( to correct &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used accessory packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see bigger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and money by high@@ lighting . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le , it automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ title the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking the respective button . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI file is created , skip &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF , the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; if you use the text search , the elements of the DVI file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as you cli@@ cked on an element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the preview is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in DVI ; -@@ viewer jumped . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is applied to a &quot; &quot; Clear &quot; &quot; and not a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection field For additional items such as keywords , notes , notes or references are available . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or another element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection possible on a selection box ) .
the author has good experience with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can naturally also be written in &amp; box ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ MO@@ s is used for defining the font size . it can be specified the font sizes for the main text , the notes notes , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets , according to the \ \ &apos; class command , contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can be done later in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the quick @-@ build button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , it should be searched for errors in the logging . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few places should have another font . &quot;
the changes are only monitored within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , it can be added certain fon@@ ts , fat , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is available for the itali@@ c pressure and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; sign language has been shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide follows the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor using the Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can print out or converted to an &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( English e V ice I n@@ d. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - Bin@@ ding files . for this only Modern can be set up under Settings box ... Tools for building them out .
&quot; to execute the preview search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source text and click on the preview button . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then performed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up settings ... Editor )
&quot; if there is an error , a error can be found . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file lists the error source in the source text . in the editor , the buttons Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and Next La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . in order to view the error line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document may either be re @-@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; most common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document using a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... General settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , it is then possible to select one &apos;s own template instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for a template on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made in the menu , directly from &amp; box . &quot;
&quot; to find out more about the book and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed through the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with an additional Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can input additional jump @-@ marks . this is an own kind of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu items Edit Tra@@ ce marks or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allow the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . thereby , this jump @-@ mark is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a character . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent opportunities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; also supports many environments and groups and therefore supports the following commands to choose text : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return text ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , you can delete it first and remove it by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ ste ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are included to delete the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that surroundings play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a more simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command for the opening of the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many surrounding environment commands , the transfer of the environment can quickly be lost . this command is the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands , which correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly fl@@ atten@@ ing bracket .
&quot; this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the braces of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted @-@ welded brackets , the overview of the structure can be lost quickly . this command is the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used for use . for the purpose of implementation , the character is used in &amp; box ; the character &quot; &quot; is used for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two complete sign marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double click character can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and there@@ with German or French characters . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when using Shift ; En@@ ter for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line breaks but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a spread@@ sheet , complete &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ associated with a complete line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in spread@@ sheets and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . when using Shift , Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ulation in the above line . &quot;
although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it has been built for different modes . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and the list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list can be shr@@ unk by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , by &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump @-@ marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with the jump @-@ brand NEW jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Pre@@ vent settings can be made to these lists . you can select different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as qui@@ vers of the common language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a few letters must be entered with \ \ begin and the calling of the full@@ size mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; box ; a special mode for the processing of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ condition mode for setting the full @-@ size environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted into the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by using the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item -@@ command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Pre@@ vent settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of recovery mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete set up . as an example of a chec@@ kl@@ ist , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word for@@ en@@ ame mode is introduced over the menu processing Ver@@ full@@ fillment and pressing C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space Bar , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large corru@@ gate books are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been established that many men in a document are written more than once . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le Compl@@ et@@ ely shut down . here , too , the threshold value can be set for the display of completion . &quot;
&quot; the full@@ size files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the per@@ sian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã Â¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics reflect the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to review the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as popular as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from sites . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the menu creation comp@@ iling , converting and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key @-@ key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be added to the Men@@ Ã Â¼ Project New Project .... By examining the following information for the project :
&quot; when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows you to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly balanced system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; delivered with many documents . includes documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . because this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; box ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be mach@@ ined with OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project , and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

clicking a source entry in the shown list puts the text @-@ po@@ inter in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen In@@ spi@@ ke ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the Advanced tab in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; apply . therefore , several templates can be present with the same matching and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template in the shown list will move the text @-@ po@@ inter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
&quot; local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code , in which a global and a local variable is declared . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you will receive a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable has a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking on the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text po@@ inter in the main window will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . all these tools use comp@@ actors as interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination produces fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . just lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more reli@@ ed on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in a war@@ ring working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and specify the folder you want in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time I started my program .
&quot; as already said , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then they let the current file simply be hoo@@ ked . if not , they delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result is named , to . the file is usually stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the winn@@ ings in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can use the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin editing plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plu@@ gins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold as they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information sent to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . it can either be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by Not@@ ation ext .
&quot; comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is part of the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters but spaces around the brackets and : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is a DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags automatically inserted . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if requested , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and finish day automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using button Def@@ ault the default settings can be restored .
&quot; standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in another way , as with file open opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been identified . however , this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . that is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the editing area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful if the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ext command line parameters .
warning messages can be used to control the display of warnings by hooks from non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able messages .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source view in split mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the picture of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing , and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty k@@ not are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the inserted information is correct . select to save the input even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
currently only a plugin is available providing support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gger needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the listening to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible , in functions and include , error @-@ adjusted . &quot;
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if it wasn &apos;t the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can get better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for mark@@ ups and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two types of file , the tag directory and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag directory and the tool@@ bar . tag files are handy , symbolic guiding of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , A &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog ; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of descrip@@ tive language and version . ( for example html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a single element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it contains the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags , which describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element only .
&quot; specify the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each attribute , att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty . &quot;
this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that termin@@ ate one day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any down@@ fall , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification takes place only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example , for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be edited for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = verb 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set up with Settings ... created . clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the button symbol assigned to this action . by clicking the User Defin@@ ed button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way &amp; qu@@ anta / scripts local scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Qu@@ anta / scripts of local scrip@@ ting folder : $ PAT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written to the standard output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create one &apos;s own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings to set actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all the necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; when available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs further programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually labeled as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is inserted ; start@@ led ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be associated with the action . this can be done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still which , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after New XML does not exist , it will create root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( s ) to be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&quot; # K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = Path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and , consequently , at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) . &quot;
spaces do not affect anything but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files are replaced .
&quot; the contents section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you have specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an Email menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several key , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to upload the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message will appear with the indication of the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type definition header : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local items represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that only this user can use them personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; pattern up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the index tab@@ s with information and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS orders to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse po@@ inter , or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; into your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box . &quot;
&quot; building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open it and to strip . in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more to Tem@@ plates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the breakdown in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation about web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed for project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed provide all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will be shown the corresponding command . the tool@@ bar &apos;s chocolate side is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why did someone else develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost any task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers reli@@ ed the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , help help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor &apos;s position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for past@@ ing files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will only create the name . actions must be stored by settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are stored by means of tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) .
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
download an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else did and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed , without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no right to write in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar if this day at this location contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will be disabled . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the ones ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line ID . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
enables display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on / off .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
edit the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can be added and the sequences can change . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ e.@@ de@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adaptation may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ ted scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started anew , do not hook up . if a project is started anew , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your own discretion . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or modified with Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the Profile window , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by showing a custom tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as saving a file . see details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced at present . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries opening and opening are missing with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the kernel and forget about programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on disk does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server where the files are to be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply sliding the view several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar menu , accessible via Settings tool bar Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this not only increases productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best made using the menu tool@@ bar . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set using context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which leads to dialog where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action edited which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu , set up Settings ... and set Settings . &quot;
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents by links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information about the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of template is useful if not a new document should always be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything , from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template to save a selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only needs to be copied into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or project files , you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can provide he@@ aders and foot@@ ers dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep in mind some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / j@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
to specify the behaviour of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a selection field with the three types described previously ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is configured in such a way , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and , by copying table contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers , allow a whole presentation to be equipped with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ability of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in sync with the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , the push of button moves the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows to change the content e.g. keywords on column names and keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way for viewing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processing , by moving with arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or remo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags is not removed before already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheets can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; are already available . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . file names in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a for@@ age called my@@ ME or a specified name name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ ME that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is test@@ 1 ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is executed automatically when loading the first sample by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each pass .

&quot; on systems with install@@ able Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys on / off through the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the previously executed commands . &quot;
&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge with complete folder . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , when merging the folder : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make it easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folders
&quot; open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a file is selected , then the merge or merging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . &quot;
&quot; the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before you start the merge . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will then start immediately . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large amount of effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as a cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . &quot;
&quot; the three spring fingers are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ar &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you may copy and insert somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or activating ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page up , end , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the edit window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy . however , be careful with this option as you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use auto @-@ return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when the user is finished and will be restored next time . ( set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also places fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed strai@@ gh@@ tened . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the respective number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , any selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es any line . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes could be displayed in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but as a white character . during merging , this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going on . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; edit the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for coding a short hint appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
switch this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C@@ or C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison windows side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line sequence to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ 1 / \ 1 / &apos; This is the found text in the first clamp number . the \ \ 1 converts the found text into capital letters .
the \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line compar@@ isons . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of used sed , you can also use something different , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before you start
... can simulate co@@ existence and display the simulated changes without actually performing them
... &quot; sel@@ ects selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging certain files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be inform@@ ing a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that were compared to that time will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded down . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object or by double the arrow keys to the left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . at folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) checked , then an error message error : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while merging , one file is processed after the other . it status column indicates that if the merge has been successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge has been completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file @-@ like method is selected for full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the three folder merge mode C will be used as a destination , and B and / or B will be used as target when synchron@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options passing , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select again directory merge / resume or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you avoid the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in other ways before proceeding with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point will mark a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively brow@@ sed . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders are checked and recur@@ sively brow@@ sed . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links will lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can be useful , for example , if the change date has been lost when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; enable synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for merging files are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view is visible while merging certain files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn the window divi@@ der into the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the folder &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merging . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # will file the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original devi@@ ate . ( please note the discretion of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select &quot; &quot; K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part &quot; &quot; from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s called Com@@ modi@@ ty ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not shared the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.@@ g k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines disappear next to each other , this fol@@ lines are often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort required so far has been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you shouldn &apos;t have problems with compile . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
&quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , clicking on the button will be removed accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible within a desktop as well as other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries to set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when you click on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; when this field is selected , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is selected , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is selected , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow them to be selected . &quot;
this displays the view of the program window . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as well known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; it displays all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal row , which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent sel@@ ections set up by switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as root or contact your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that constantly expands to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you &amp; K@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window will be called magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you &amp; K@@ mag ; to do this , you can present a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently unable to recognize the form of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press &amp; Shift , press the Shift or Shift &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save into a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot;
start or stop updating the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically use your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Lo@@ ose &amp; etc . &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen@@ shot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen as if you are using a magni@@ fier in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and cause pain to any mouse click . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and cause pain to any mouse click . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking over the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic means of help : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion , before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can drag the drag by pressing the mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a click of the mouse .
&quot; if the mouse button is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button shut@@ down , the mouse button will wait until the mouse button takes place again . &quot;
&quot; this feature activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this move is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt for the first time , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic click , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick stays without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window that does not present a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be scra@@ ped with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent sliding in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . however , if you want to do a keyboard input , use the mouse . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the cli@@ p@@ board , or perform any other action you need to make the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you are just starting &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , use a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this makes every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart move is moving the shift time . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . but it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed ; this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and speaker and it is set up correctly . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , right @-@ click once the mouse cur@@ sor continues . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; has been developed by Gun@@ n@@ ar Sch@@ mi D@@ t Gun@@ n@@ ar @ tam@@ i @-@ dt@@ .de , Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Jeff Rous@@ h Jeff @ m@@ ous@@ eto@@ ol@@ .com . &quot;
&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that are to be repeated from a list of the conversation history . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can balance the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains basically an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that should be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word supplement and the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character encoding with the text to be passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator , unchanged as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Ã¤m@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pass@@ book or in the list for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen passage of text is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen passage is entered first only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , the editing window for text pass@@ book allows you to determine whether the text pass@@ book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to save changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Save Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for the word supplement . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , and in the course of time create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings - mouth , setup ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice output . ( see the settings dialog for language synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently it supports only English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ette folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in other examples : &quot;
&quot; ( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v , r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v &quot;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the language generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can output text by the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer contains . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that enables any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via the program speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
&quot; Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ de voice @-@ over@@ s ; , an application without visible window that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; kate , with which a text file can be read completely or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ m@@ n . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise , the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher will otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printing expectations for the same printer .
&quot; if you click the tab on the tab &quot; &quot; tab &quot; &quot; in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cart@@ on card is displayed . it also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all the speakers already established appear in this list . the top actors appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the spokes@@ persons in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; choose a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost . go back to the map tab and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled for the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs and kt@@ ops ; next , if the field speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the control bar &apos;s system pane , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the list of orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that is to be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the enlarged text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check the text that is to be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . &quot;
this also works when it &apos;s embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you about events that you have set up . you can also read &amp; extract the text of these messages . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , to notify you when an IR@@ C channel pop@@ s up a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supported by a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are processed in filters before being sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos;s program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
&quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order that you send orders from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such read , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be provided with pre@@ defined string sub@@ stitution filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; form@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for transl@@ ating &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ml .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that the text is sent to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the list speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules don &apos;t apply , it passes the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the configured normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string sub@@ stitution filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it must differ only from the names of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . &quot;
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that will save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to see a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
you can get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character @-@ chain replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must be limited to both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the speaker sel@@ ector filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker features that the program provides , which provides the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the features of the speaker appointed on the card card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the right button to view the dialogue speaker selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open up kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
no one of the above speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able is working at all . that &apos;s what you have to do if you don &apos;t use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that entire sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ ries . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which can be found in the related documentation or on the relevant web pages . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the c@@ de@@ file package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can find it in kt@@ ts@@ d . in addition , you can find the source code from k@@ de@@ file under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dispens@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code archive for c@@ de@@ cryp@@ t or download the tar@@ ball currently created all night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ops ; first , check whether speech schedul@@ er works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can leave articles or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used automatically by the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Add speaker on the list , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card spokesperson configuration is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , which &amp; kt@@ ts ; are known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider lets you adjust the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply to Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card card spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected from the list below . ( but not every order is made up of several sentences ) . &quot;

this card card lets you set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of voice orders :
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pronoun@@ ces messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and expendi@@ tures of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops ; ignored . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of actors as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages into a file . use the button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ml is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone Voice ( British Male ) , as this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ ute identi@@ fier filters ( SD@@ B Fil@@ ters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds submit text into individual sentences . this allows you to start or stop the whole text , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set of rules identi@@ fiers is set up automatically . you can modify its settings or add further stat@@ ute identi@@ fiers , but beginners will be advised . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the device selection is to select the speaker selection . switch off the speaker selection and enter text for reading . if you select the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time &quot;
&quot; you can pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal sentence limit@@ er filter is set up automatically if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for articles and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ew ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute identi@@ fier filter from compare , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card reader selection , you can over@@ ride the voice settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the cart@@ on card spokesperson ) . in other words : no ch@@ Spe@@ aker properties are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is , if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language than the one inserted in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker selection button and use the speaker , which is best suited to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trace back . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved this is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes and kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / quotes , add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; there is a setting speed on the audio card . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ module like Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card for speaker equipment . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml conversion filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops ; read the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . to make the festival no mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a separate string release filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ am ; do not go back or go back . on the Cart@@ ridge orders it is displayed that the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for the set limit detection instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by running the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; also freezes if you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current sentence is read al@@ oud . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with apt @-@ get install so@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ file echo ctu@@ ts@@ d &gt; inst @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you start , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received using the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this phone . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone . more information can be found here . &quot;
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival fÃ¼r deutsche &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . required is festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the error correction is not required , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just insert the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give language over festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . get and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer working with di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthes@@ izer is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; site and un@@ zip them to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
on the card device device selection select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
&quot; epo@@ s is a free speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the list box . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in one &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; lin@@ ux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adaptation of the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the Network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list which is best suited to distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network interfaces are displayed .
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... to be edited in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button and display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP settings for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP settings for each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected . &quot;
&quot; with the manual selection , the TCP / IP configuration can be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on the need , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . disable an activated network device is done by selecting the list and clicking on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator provides a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then added to the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . dialog Edit is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list Nam@@ tu@@ ally known hosts describes IP @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list of commonly known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Add the New alias dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known host has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name that is known to you from the list and select Edit ... The dialog of your computer will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like a k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended for experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be communicated .
IP networks are currently operated using TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in other networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , which is a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an area reserved specifically for that purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a separate lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs on a schedule in the background . it &apos;s a graphical interface for the UNIX Â® system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you are using &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . &quot;
&quot; if the task is disabled , program name and parameter are not displayed , and the description will be disabled . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables , which appear here , use the otherwise existing environment variables for all of the tasks listed here , except in force . in a de@@ activated variable , it is disabled as a description . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to Edit New .... alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the tasks folder and select C@@ tr@@ l ; N in the contex@@ tual menu New ... or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter here the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Select .... &quot;
&quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you specify both month ( s ) and week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be carried out in a suitable date and on a suitable day of the week . if you choose for example the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be run on the 1st and 15th of the elected months , regardless of the day of the week , no matter what date they will fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be activated when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to edit Sel@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select cut out , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;

&quot; &amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you backup ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; get back the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . if you don &apos;t know &amp; dat , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the Status Bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape entry . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat , speci@@ fying by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat - continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the file for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
&quot; once the check@@ out process is started , the dialog box appears for review . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , you need to mark the files that are to be restored . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu .
&quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialog settings for restoration will appear . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ un@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ ited &amp; transm@@ ited ; before the tape is embedded , the command is loading to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , attempted &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection with the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not ; you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
&quot; if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only contain a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period when the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol . if this does not appear , then you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not to be started with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or set strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified , so that only log lines that match the selected filter are displayed . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and then insert the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so you will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the Level Er@@ r@@ ors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than log lines of the step note . the color display of protocol lines can be disabled . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new addition protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a record in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which only once is started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial area :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change it , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no proper files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; quite simply , each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that can only have ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running level or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original running level ( or its position ) .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new running level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , running level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another running level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode , then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under running X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly established . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux Â® run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two map cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User and Group Properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have disabled space constraints ( quota ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make custom settings . more card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card password management appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitations of space in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected with space limitation using the field file system .
&quot; the map groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , which the user owns , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
