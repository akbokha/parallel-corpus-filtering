<seg id="3">"automatic translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert into translating texts directly."</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Upgrading... Open the tab toolbox and select the desired modules there."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"you should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package."</seg>
<seg id="10">"to use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page which & konqueror; crashes, or delete the list of crashes, if available."</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View Filters (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras' View Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of plotting nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily identified, can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX Â® command you are considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap presentation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over the View color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles will occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always adhered to. it is drawn in order to represent the nesting of entries, and this framework will need space, which is then lost to subordinate entries, if the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed space for an entry on the menu item View View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent details to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; home page to find news about shared versions and other information about & digitised; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved & digitized; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter your path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnail images can be read out reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach a common modular structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digikam; even carry out."</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenedim, above the horizontal dividing line or another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner come in a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scanned colors. with a colour-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should give you links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting further manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, adjust, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Corrigible Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the brightness values over the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"similarly, almost every brightness area produces the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">"enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed out images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8 bits per colour. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the upper right a histogram is shown that changes dynamically once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play a stat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and load do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the default settings return all the filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles can be used to consult the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can always use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digicode; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created if one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image was completed. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; Effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"the blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychosuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process is combined with minimal differences to a colour point."</seg>
<seg id="484">"images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners apply a field of sharpness already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to view the rigid sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies also the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image sharpens the tool. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften with the menu item Correct soft-drawing and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, the noise and the impression of grates are generated near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurring image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpness and therefore avoid plastic fault in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blur was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicode; tool refocusing refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted defaltation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the GauÃ's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the GauÃ's folding is influenced even very strongly by the remote pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your blur is gauss. in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasurable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp Masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"even under optimal conditions, it is never possible to remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods for sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>

<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should ensure that no sharpening is necessary subsequently."</seg>
<seg id="520">Directions Addiction Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothen [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-amplitude da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, small angles should also be chosen small. therefore, make sure that small angles create a long term. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="530">Noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information on sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>

<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blurred the image. the area specified by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor flaws adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing on the front of the filter to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: checks the edge of the filter for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically mitigated."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of the phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges may appear smoother if it is too high. it can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft sign and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>

<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the opposite character of the parameter General."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>

<seg id="924">"the viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, it can scan your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a larger image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, set the different folders and the URL to where your site is stored."</seg>

<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import pictures should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personer the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>
<seg id="947">"in this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) selecting the information about your images, via (2) searching and viewing up to (3) advanced themes and customization options."</seg>

<seg id="959">"since the modules are used by several applications among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always try new modules first with the demo database before you apply them to your own images."</seg>
<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications don't support their pictures in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;"</seg>

<seg id="969">"one of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to use any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. for example, on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen."</seg>
<seg id="970">"all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer."</seg>
<seg id="971">"see three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, therefore, that the names used up are moved up, the people find and assign them faster."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a MoirÃ© pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is increasingly divided and adaptively because the depth of recursion depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams each pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued further and further subdivided. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the title to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, upload the information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself."</seg>

This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must first be installed, if this has not yet happened."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders."</seg>

<seg id="1659">See that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, you will see how General MIDI patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, you can enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds to the percussion channel, for example, take a look at the provided key maps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you are using the Keymap option, the keymap must of course continue to be defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that will change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio shows in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the channel view menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"disagree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"first, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">"you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open on a & kde; Desktop an & conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file only in the & konqueror; move the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's assume you have the MIDI Files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly that a MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = func2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2html tag3 = tag2html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">"note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and, consequently, at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!)."</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the contents section is the section of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just as you have specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an Email menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) sending email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>

<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have several key, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to upload the upload."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local items represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; pattern up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size."</seg>

<seg id="2087">"you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS orders to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer, or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; into your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog box."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & diff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">"& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge with complete folder. this screen shot shows & kdiff3, when merging the folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are shown visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make it easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"if a file is selected, then the merge or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"the setting button opens a dialog with settings. here, you can set options before you start the merge."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison will then start immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large amount of effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as a cutting and inserting (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three spring fingers are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [Gear] when you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you may copy and insert somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting the sources ignoring the numbers or activating ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white signs."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigate in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page up, end, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the edit window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-image upward / Ctrl-image downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the clipboard to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copy. however, be careful with this option as you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems do not use auto-return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files."</seg>

<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) store a car back character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only save a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes could be displayed in the page-to-page comparison, but as a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters."</seg>

<seg id="2334">"in automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is going on."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre-processing commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Cor C / C + + comments.)</seg>

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line sequence to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /\ 1 /\ 1 / 'This is the found text in the first clamp number. the\\ 1 converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line comparisons. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of used sed, you can also use something different, e.g. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-off algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal pre-processor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>

<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup, & ksystemlog; first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol. if this does not appear, then you have & ksystemlog; most likely not to be started with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or set strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified, so that only log lines that match the selected filter are displayed. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and then insert the name of a process in the filterbar, so you will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the Level Errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than log lines of the step note. the color display of protocol lines can be disabled."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new addition protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a record in the menu."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init, without a reinstallation and re-formatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following more folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which only once is started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change it, then you can fix it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no proper files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"quite simply, each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that can only have httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running level or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original running level (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new running level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, running level 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another running level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>

<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode, then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK)."</seg>

<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions."</seg>

<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrongly established."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux Â® runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual."</seg>
