&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US was only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion he never stays behind the mountain , as one says so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican Ele@@ ction , was the highest number obtained by the nom@@ inees from the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also Tr@@ ump &apos;s world view was not consistent with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns playing .
&quot; the intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life for a long time , and her husband , Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump embark@@ ed on his way to the nom@@ inees of Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( equivalent to the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ) : white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the big Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump@@ ets , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
&quot; music , which lives with the waste &quot;
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays - are on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers started to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early stages : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic rub@@ b@@ ish dump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ an waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were anger@@ ed accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were mobili@@ zing fast against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that had then driven the prime ministers out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the s@@ nail &apos;s pace , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , ex@@ changing news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to label ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , imagin@@ ative names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You may not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found fle@@ eing ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross this , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines various levels of information with each other , and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i will help to find discrimin@@ ating ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Agency : a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to view the position of every trace@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ est criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that formerly were fishing without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tra@@ w@@ l nets on board , whose use was prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear annually through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they used a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; her articles will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times , and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot; &quot;
street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the inaugur@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes were negotiating the political and economic crisis of the country , re@@ acted by meeting in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recall of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centre @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o , and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is continually worsen@@ ing , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on to join the National Assembly on 27 October as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on November 3 , to continue the blocking of the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that talk about disputes , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safe again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Guard did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the scale of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado hold that 1 % of signatures are fake .

&quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that , from their point of view , have taken little against the devastating economic crisis , and rather occupied themselves to silence critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba , Qui@@ j@@ ano came up against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not select his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was all right . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not yet realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the Intelligence Department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

records of the archive .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called for me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole ; you are friends with one of the ERP .
just make sure that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers Party . &quot;
&quot; that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a huge l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard . &quot;
&quot; suddenly he pointed to an open space , saying : &quot;
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I sne@@ aked in and saw a couch , where men were tortured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
&quot; they seldom caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water and drove him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell right away again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose Luis L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked persons were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me away ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed him .
&quot; according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , charges the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came from above that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it was called - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that one takes away from an enemy you fought . &quot;

records of records
&quot; but if you go to a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that &apos;s no boot@@ y , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; You who steal the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have simply put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did not these people also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
&quot; the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I repro@@ ached him because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly troubled and asked myself what the entire exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court suspended prison sentences and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; during the dictatorship , all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , an Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were killed during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto an &quot; terrible car drive &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ fortune . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; is mistaken on a shield , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil hin@@ d@@ sight &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine which has been widely shared in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper published in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been included in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger talked about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News approached the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are implic@@ ated nationwide in accidents , is a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , which corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the number of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned re@@ porter published comments on the light showing the prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to be against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on translation errors received , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , to understand the original text and to convey active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , co@@ sting or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; mechanical translations are also widely used , often with funny results . &quot;
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies particularly to some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints , often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected more accurately .
the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; head of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
later other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as that were organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was cra@@ cked and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet site seems to be closed again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission was threatening them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ film@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond in error or deny the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was set up on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was deta@@ ined . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country . &quot;

T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a formal draft report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can - and all this within the framework of a contract which cannot be lifted . &quot;
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees silence in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their training , can improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family welcomes the girl and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of severe be@@ atings . shortly after she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest r@@ allies and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the time , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that you still have time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but got no food in@@ definitely . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but she was not convers@@ ing with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would be &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , it was perfectly clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the moder@@ ator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .

the social inequality in Paraguay and that of putting power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ents recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would be set up that is intended to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six sections and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration of users and users . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register , considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users with a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall blocked by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , says Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who apply for authorisation or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ised and that no other nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was imposed for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in Iraq

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the existence of a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to portra@@ y another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
&quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had an atomic accident , and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses alone . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the concerned themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i achieved the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned shut@@ ters were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light of 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , still , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated housing shel@@ ters ( such as the &quot; &quot; Gar@@ ments , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; were evacu@@ ated into final replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ way catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , have re @-@ opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agricultural land , have suffered large areas of suffering . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the land land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed have still not been done enough in disaster prevention . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement buildings . &quot;
&quot; as of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ates are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas , older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration expresses her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer had struck him with a stick in Go@@ i@@ ana &apos;s head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
&quot; the pictures show the face of the police officer , attacking with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he performs in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care station , his face would be visible for six months on TV and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ er@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are rus@@ hing to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also sub@@ merged in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been divided several times into social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police intervention against demonstr@@ ators took place last Friday .
&quot; police officers deployed in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo their front pages illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
one must also recognize this if one is strictly opposed to any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are disgu@@ ised by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Lost Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , does not ro@@ b the crisis in the sugar cane industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds one of the fact that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a subject for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the congregation saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he most frequently repeated , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the location to be maintained , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first jubil@@ ee , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills which were still in operation . &quot; he ass@@ ures .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services provided by the facilities in the commun@@ es in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ rupt it , they stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , its production serves not even for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do it with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres for 2014 to teach young groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e Communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop begins with the fact that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever they come to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases were not solved . &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalisation is .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our sh@@ out
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and as well as our youth go forward &quot;
so they can do what they have destined for the Creator
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse to sil@@ o script ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; A@@ es@@ thetic Models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a lot of these small companies , which produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile phones decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food supplements is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , a Kais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can view more bizarre plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the H@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at@@ est &quot; &quot; in the world . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and o@@ est@@ ments regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs every weekend according to his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where are we going to get here ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I pass on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or look at it as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &apos; hero@@ ic deeds &apos; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; it is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ aking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals held money from her business month for month until they destroyed the business , but also tore her family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as they do not know when they will be kidn@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; in these aw@@ ful days I asked if wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the response is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , warm tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody pse of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was viol@@ ated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links contain images , on which violence is portrayed . &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DRC and Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated , the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; public officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie theater near , which was full of people who looked at the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and cor@@ p@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to mis@@ chief .
&quot; a picture titled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make up the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people look at them . &quot;
but here the story does not come to an end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been zo@@ omed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am fighters attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and shr@@ ub@@ s .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to number cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sh@@ attered , shot or burned . &quot;
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated with satellite images .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo came up again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; even one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely mis@@ lead the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning alert , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee attacks , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following were shown , bringing these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page which fal@@ sely claimed to be President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the image of the DR Congo to cover this information . &quot;
&quot; the original article , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , mistakenly attributed this statement to Th@@ ein Sein , but did not bring the picture out of the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false data
traces of these false coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an inver@@ ted picture search , you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ on of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries , based on the publication on which page they were published . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( in some cases also linked together ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false messages . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger who prosec@@ utes the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government issued a correction to what it was intended to be &quot; pur@@ pos@@ eful news and photos that came to the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judge , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech are operating and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; time to catch a while ? &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the picture of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image will continue to contain it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ aned ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Indon@@ esian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false . &quot;
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos distance himself from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DRC .
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye is also not fully trace@@ able to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ mes@@ hes ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in regard to greater discussions about the silence related to the mur@@ der@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal coinci@@ des with the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed and the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used detached from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( z. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
&quot; there are such words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt at a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit of context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - In@@ take care of your parents in recognition of how your younger years have stri@@ ved .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having been war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ ame other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; &quot; un@@ miss@@ able &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and land@@ slides in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which is normally used at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ agi@@ a and At@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud waves . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were killed in 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls arrived on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floods are exac@@ erb@@ ating the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies to the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and food for high water victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
&quot; the taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ophi@@ le Centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of Ro@@ an@@ u &apos;s tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a S@@ OS button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of emergency and help remedi@@ al measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next row , we are adding rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they dis@@ car@@ n@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , are lim@@ eli@@ zed . &quot;
to be de@@ mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western notion , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been dating western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed fo@@ ols dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body that these are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead to change . &quot;
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children are often aimed at anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong to
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not carry all the pick@@ pockets with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists , and inter @-@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape by a well @-@ trained Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it , Islamic hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head scar@@ f . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the everyday ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim faith is always part of my shadow . &quot;

to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - for centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; empire &quot; which has founded a company called &quot; &quot; Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien &quot; &quot; company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country over a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he introduced the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy affects the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple connec@@ tive lines , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing branch of &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility to this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders against people from just the countries , which bom@@ bed it . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; , &quot; which largely respects Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we throw away on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations We Have To Lead
we are too deeply dis@@ cour@@ aged to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous bil@@ l@@ able prints that we are perpet@@ u@@ ating in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .

there is another group that grew expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet been given it ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously soli@@ di@@ fying the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; as my girlfriend and I have been bombar@@ ding a new future in which we have no president , while he already vom@@ ited broken countries and &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
is there a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible response . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot;
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; while listening to &quot; listening often with it , &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to , &quot; to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience lets itself be informed . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ u@@ ok@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; on 3 April 2017 , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico . the march started at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad &apos;s Front for the No@@ ise Testing of Deb@@ t ) and the Com@@ eni@@ al Church Assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the restructuring of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are liable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be black@@ mailing and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will risk being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ BS@@ P campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , published books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available for roy@@ alty free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the A@@ dra prison directory , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the detention of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in the military court of his cell in A@@ dra on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Siegel , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ vision@@ ally than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bo@@ dying this architecture not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent all my life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read and write English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ se that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; that I bear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tia &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under assault by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted by corruption , post office release again on previous post &quot;
&quot; with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to corruption in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , whose Council presi@@ ded over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who issued the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with the German Wave : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the re@@ fut@@ ation .
&quot; however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; dispro@@ portion@@ ate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re @-@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
to the contrary !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ u , that a th@@ ief is in jail : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belonging to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ u prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ tive , and - by the way - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released . &quot;
&quot; # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Goo@@ db@@ ye , Hungary , France , Germany &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt : @ truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mozambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long term imprisonment , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or gap @-@ b@@ se . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Plac@@ ement &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call itself hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people reported that also posts , in which they discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for its use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before fighting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words that are next .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , the hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the campaign may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I prohibited the li@@ king , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before starting the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; heredi@@ tary cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not include hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; post saying &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to further heat the violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; for its failure , Facebook has been critici@@ zed for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law which aims to ban this practice , so that the age of marri@@ ages is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as the age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to abol@@ ish laws of child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again : &quot;
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ ha@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not a single vote against it . &quot;
&quot; once approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on the children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has used too much time and unnecessary talk , which conce@@ als the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel @-@ Jackson thought it took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted by law . &quot;
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # Pat@@ ag@@ it@@ ei@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users would wish to address the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; rather satellite if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can provoke only panic and dis@@ grace , we would just talk about that the state , our daughters from preventing them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are opposite to them , would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor was hack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l District . hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Abi@@ de at home . &quot; &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the side - however , it remained in the cache . &quot;
it &apos;s # spar@@ ed
&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has closed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , multiple mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now sur@@ faced . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , however , is available in spite of the legal ban . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the ban on Wikipedia ) , we all decided to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to check out at least all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar folders when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff of Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; you access another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed @-@ out colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , how he helps him in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live on the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
I rested just at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know that because he stood face to face tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice is alive . &quot;
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with names .
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not name their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far less legal advice to fear , if any , they should not come up with this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ yer has been working with her video camera to detect practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and leads this club . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing the Roh@@ ini in its discussion was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
&quot; she chose this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; not to speak out loud in the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they owe all liability and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this will be regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; initially , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women can never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only ki@@ cked out during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ bing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini obtained a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put to the woman : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never been so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of discussion and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own choice of dress , mor@@ als combined with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since its initial discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are coming slowly : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some of them , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of dress - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les official YouTube channel .
&quot; on June 29 , this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag , the &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day &quot; &quot; was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today , the Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day is in Japan . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs by the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English lessons at Japanese medium schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; the Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in the year 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day . &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
today I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believers , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and the result was that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can contain gold , or can bring wealth , declared the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya resi@@ des in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men , who travel to Mozambique , are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bur@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the prosecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably ab@@ used rituals , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique in dis@@ cord ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ME ashamed A country where people would have shame to go to the street as if they would not hurt men or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; that aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and thrilled Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ ange and the polic@@ eman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald : &quot;

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ing the State ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and said a spokesman , he did not consider it necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
unified nations
&quot; R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable the treatment of Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway : Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as announced in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they will be able to meet and receive all visits that they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that &quot; &quot; the Americans &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US embassy request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley stated that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany : Germany
&quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had big concerns , whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in a statement on June 29 , France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded that China release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on 27 June , showing a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed his concern in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he had been severely punished for , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally , I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ er@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are not a country in the end . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; countries , in view of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who preten@@ ded to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system . &quot;
he tar@@ ried appropriate questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critics point out that one should start reading the entire script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; Be no country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ing ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes that , and is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advocate ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet of Cab@@ inet , statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but they only defend their city , but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ or@@ ean ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices , recently , asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ? &quot;
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook angry when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that makes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they &apos;re travelling .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it would not matter to me , if one would conf@@ use me to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means basically to be sp@@ oo@@ ky - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian double @-@ go@@ er ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; that can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ od@@ orized the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these photos of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; change the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and prosec@@ ute people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ z@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , isol@@ ation@@ ists , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ k@@ ho@@ v@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deserted and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where linen is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the ruined building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ hierarch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages for free . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial support from her daughter , insi@@ sting that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
ante G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , she recalls the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 child benefit for every child .
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garden once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them . &quot;
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they are running , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ authenticity in their lives . &quot;
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is managed by a 59 year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
&quot; for approximately $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that people come to full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication which they cannot pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if mother Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) poses with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , it &apos;s normal to make a first stop in South America and then pull north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans have already spoken to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et worked in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will be in contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are left to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez may well be known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single mother , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family still lives there , trying to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , travellers should consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grand@@ ma , she leaves many photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens , who made her a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya I fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users at the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app is designed to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on users &apos; experiences in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet based on Twitter &quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; International Mini@@ stries &quot; &quot; ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents at random , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are found at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China have also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones are connected to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all branches of government , government and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; at the local police station . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is , three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where all important things have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
&quot; one , who gives honour to their name . &quot;
one that has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality re@@ covers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts come up in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth turns on on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five youths were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all the districts sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working . &quot;
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious image that filled my expectations with full satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ wed it all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel of Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel of Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are courageous enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you trust me to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure in my case when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; like his father , right away . &quot;
the smell of this cursed sentence is still in my nose today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I scre@@ amed the court .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; after that , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I give me all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I am allowed to contact me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an ancient method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ite &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him , if I remain . &quot;
a liar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; &quot; th@@ under &quot; , &quot; reference to 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am accustomed to not answering .
I really can no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate confession .
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cries . &quot;
&quot; my cries were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector before or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable , from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the ranks . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not really enjoy it , which is why it was next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to store my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me like a few minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about terrible troubles . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition &quot;
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he slides to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ low@@ workers ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned their ancient opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian woman of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while in water dissolved Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam in a hot young day . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary representatives who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual Fron@@ ts@@ Ã¤n@@ ger Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert hall . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Spo@@ kes@@ person of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism that issue the well @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely not simply to be shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ or@@ r@@ ors &apos; has increased in Jordan , which is left un@@ official . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it was ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan lack@@ ed institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a 1954 anti @-@ crime law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their release , many times of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is well @-@ known not to shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been in@@ filtr@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse frequently repe@@ ats itself : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equal opportunities of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were ri@@ pped , twisted and reviewed in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly promotes the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ de , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ de , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service firmly accepted several former government decre@@ es and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they would have been critical of the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , reas@@ oned and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial forms of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ at@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the exu@@ ber@@ ant hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has resulted in more and more regular citizens entering the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
courtesy . use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
&quot; precisely this question came to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as who have lived in illegal camps for many years have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and , around the clock , wore their weapons , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as fighters to welcome them back to society .
the campaign &apos;s aim is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued , to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art travelled to the camp to personally over@@ take the letters . &quot;
the F@@ ARC members set up as they had previously done to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an associate of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer them . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the gar@@ net . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organisation , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has imp@@ acted upon the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would prevail after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ cha , whose first publication took place on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a translator , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the long run . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ former who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you cry ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
&quot; apparently , some women had taken everything together and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two sm@@ s in my right lung wing . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which case were you laid , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name is on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they posed absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad news and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have body size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother got too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , there was a car with dark windows and a plate plate with a 95 on top . &quot;
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I still cannot grasp how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought her without recording me , without knowing anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a topic of t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with the camera , I really try to look like the person she looks like from her past - so to my male shape . &quot;
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ t@@ ted ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask for evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced satisfaction through blood . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many people .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be present later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new of them ever since .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us closer to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but in the end we were thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria never hurt me a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed that you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov joined the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about women &apos;s behaviour . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; whoever laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the worsen@@ ing of the situation in the Republic . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
&quot; I discovered these people myself , when I cli@@ pped them off . &quot;
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ off ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
&quot; nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be exact , different attitudes . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named Y@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture , as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Employment and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who seek a job completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans , emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminine * in general .
&quot; for example , today , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still runs through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is known to me and well @-@ known .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I &apos;m talking about skin color , on racism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord &quot; &quot; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and home places earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women again and again .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings which , in addition to cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ums@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) refers to the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq based documentary film and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on traced , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Conc@@ tural . the article is part of the # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er series , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police chief told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time past and the police said their statement would be laid to the files , but nothing can be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman , Bal@@ bu@@ ena , was shown for abuse , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed ad was also useful . &quot;
a few days later the second wife with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women publish advertisements in general , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who mi@@ stre@@ ate them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must notify the prosecution authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that is not under@@ scor@@ ing Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation of strokes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are actually mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were filed for domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ erial Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; 9 women who do not do this are reported to every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she continued . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot;
I would never have thought I would once become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) composed of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
&quot; in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse . &quot;
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements in the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , she did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # sovereign ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # NGOs ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare fem@@ ici@@ dal to an individual criminal off@@ ence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the text of the law was changed in some respects to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ een that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which the victims of violence must be borne by themselves , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure lodging to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the prosecution of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
we must re@@ pay as long as mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been am@@ ended , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after a newspaper continues to ban attacks
&quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Arab authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in jail where he served a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and tried again later . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he lam@@ ents the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos; rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , limiting and imprisonment of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities are systematically limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and preventing citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested after an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of putting under pressure judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited to the special department at ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was forbidden in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es of 3000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) and a one @-@ year ban on professional ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 US dollars was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gement of Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from the prison prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his first sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the US government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information has personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with what the Minister filed another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in recent times .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have their legitimate human rights work un@@ imp@@ eded and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with its consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research to be carried out on site : on the one hand there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research conducted by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
A@@ GA : what do you think of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being cre@@ ators themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often un@@ usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the financing and chances of development are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky first appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about sol@@ vents for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security concern the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a century @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds Sal@@ ad , but it takes longer because his work is more and more difficult due to ever more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; we have to do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have bred red ro@@ asting sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station and tested , whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the move from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the use of other seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow@@ ing - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the prof@@ ited professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by brid@@ ging seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered for example on farmer &apos;s markets . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material that is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ bility
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . currently , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is other breeders , because &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to achieve the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; that is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties . &quot;
my concept is perfectly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such , which move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , also without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , you are protected from competition with what you think it &apos;s pretty easy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements an open source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; a statement , however , is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems for planning the official start @-@ up next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible web pages and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking of the government and reflected what it meant for him : &quot;
&quot; this , blocking blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; I managed to convey the feeling of a siege to me ; arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that the Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; the situation is further ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis using which it can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second largest city and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air@@ stream to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice has even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; known for detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper :
&quot; more will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then raises questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than they use ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as showed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; for years , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been particularly well @-@ known to the company Glob@@ o , which , like C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit installed by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing one unit there . &quot;
&quot; for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports about har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux lec@@ tured from one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also results in serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police cl@@ ot@@ he the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected , where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebel forces outside of Damascus , leading to the need for local residents to be transported on local or through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional , planted food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that it has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; famili@@ arity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used to collect money for the initiative . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from regions , &quot; &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
&quot; fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts , spreading out in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European Forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense of the word &quot; &quot; # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &quot; &quot; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

the Visi@@ ble Trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door so that everything could be built , &quot; says Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , are spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade , and in October this fat@@ eful weekend was so crucial that the servers were not able to stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million people . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; even if his mother did not say so , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe never again . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high rates of money . however , it is true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organization &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which , after the application of the asylum application , can still go for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions very soon .
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Lux@@ ury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity stand . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : bill of law from Egypt enables shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill showing that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months following the successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , indicating their full name and identity number . &quot;
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or a penalty of pen@@ alties .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another Member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high civil servant would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , however , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; as for Sha@@ w@@ kan , more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , were sentenced to four years in prison for a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan men@@ tions the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , including tru@@ ste@@ es , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the fin@@ es of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gated documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ res@@ bia , the co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ res@@ bia has been largely interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , endor@@ ses a controversial draft bill that would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , poses a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation look like . &quot;
Ben G@@ res@@ bia denied the separation of his sources according to Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which journalists attributed the right to the protection of their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identification ?
&quot; according to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
it is also stated in the regulations that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; do we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey supported the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop puff@@ ing up
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
