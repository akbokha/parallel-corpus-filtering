<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US was only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion he never stays behind the mountain, as one says so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican Election, was the highest number obtained by the nominees from the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also Trump's world view was not consistent with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the Phoenix Suns playing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life for a long time, and her husband, Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump embarked on his way to the nominees of Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(equivalent to the White against all other ethnicities): white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as the big Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumpets, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" no! "they cried, and their voices louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later, he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now trumps land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">"music, which lives with the waste"</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays - are on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers started to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early stages:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic rubbish dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated in liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were angered accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobilizing fast against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that had then driven the prime ministers out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail's pace, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, exchanging news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to label ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, imaginative names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "says Long." "in the past a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You may not run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross this, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines various levels of information with each other, and FISH-i will help to find discriminating ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Agency: a platform that offers satellite data and can be used to view the position of every traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detest criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that formerly were fishing without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found trawl nets on board, whose use was prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear annually through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with certainty, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used trawl nets which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they used a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called on to join the National Assembly on 27 October as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on November 3, to continue the blocking of the referendum on the inauguration of the National Assembly."</seg>

<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"meanwhile, in the course of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba, Quijano came up against his father."</seg>
<seg id="201">"in the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not select his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I believed that it was all right."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"I could not yet realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the Intelligence Department in La Perla from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="222">"the abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers Party."</seg>
<seg id="223">"that is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. some days later, he took me to work on the military base."</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a huge lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">"suddenly he pointed to an open space, saying:"</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I sneaked in and saw a couch, where men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom caught a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrew him with water and drove him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was terrific... like a dirty winch.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell right away again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose Luis López, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked persons were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people crouched quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you see, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I said," "Why have you brought me away?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed him.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera trial, charges the students Raúl Mateo Molina to death."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial Site, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the abductions came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement came from above that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'booty'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as it was called - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bayonet or perhaps military sign that one takes away from an enemy you fought."</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Records of records</seg>
<seg id="273">"but if you go to a house and the refrigerator, the record player, clothing, painting, money... steals, then that's no booty, but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I said," "You who steal the cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in rage, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of that time, on which I wore a jacket and a pullover of wool. both had my dad from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought clothes with home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abhorrent act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you can see the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship, but why the bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">One could have simply put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did not these people also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorrent act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was re-introduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you will never find anything, "my father said."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him because of all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly troubled and asked myself what the entire exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I've seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he said," "Well, then tell me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I made the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I had finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can blame me for being biased. I have finally said against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto in which one can prolong his driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, last month witnessed a particularly misfortune."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the" "older driver" "is mistaken on a shield, which means" older drivers, "falsely - but perhaps also with evil hindsight & # 8212; as" terrible motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper published in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "Holmes said."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was first removed. the term" "dangerous drivers" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake had already been included in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger talked about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely feel that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News approached the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are implicated nationwide in accidents, is a cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, which corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors made 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the number of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the version of the article published on Yahoo, the above-mentioned reporter published comments on the light showing the prejudices some Japanese seem to be against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo on translation errors received, among other things, the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is this (" "terrible motorists" ") about not reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "How bad is the translation not at all, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think it's a true translation error.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills, to understand the original text and to convey active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, costing or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">"mechanical translations are also widely used, often with funny results."</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies particularly to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">"head of the portal" Navegar con Libertad "(Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)."</seg>
<seg id="392">"on Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas that were organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was cracked and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS."</seg>

<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen, "which is edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">"Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family, who lived there."</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she started working as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money overpasses her underage son or her underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can - and all this within the framework of a contract which cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criadita guarantees silence in general."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their training, can improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family welcomes the girl and justifies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training, and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they even never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of severe beatings. shortly after she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in her house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">"organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, responsible for the death of the girl."</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest rallies and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl, who was her Criminta."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paraguays, a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour force; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all the time, and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and the infected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but got no food indefinitely." "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge," "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, changed by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliaments recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would be set up that is intended to give citizens a permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adopting the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six sections and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration of users and users. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register, considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users with a user name and password to get through the firewall blocked by Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist, the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), says Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who apply for authorisation or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor people's activities and to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in which the control is maximised and that no other narration is present on the surface, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed legislation against cyber crime in which a life sentence was imposed for those who were found guilty of threatening" public order "and" to protest. ""</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the existence of a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza loves to portray another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">"for six years, she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="532">"since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the north-east of Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "in March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"the prefecture of Fukushima had an atomic accident, and alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi achieved the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned shutters were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light of 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated housing shelters (such as the" "Garments, Kazetsu juutaku" "were evacuated into final replacement buildings."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-way catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"according to the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, have re-opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of the agricultural land, have suffered large areas of suffering."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the land land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear barrier. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 per cent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuates."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed have still not been done enough in disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacuates from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture has also witnessed the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuates from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement buildings."</seg>
<seg id="580">"as of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home-prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuates are older than 50 years old in the disaster areas, older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"the sugar cane industry still stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete scaffolding remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier-veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, does not rob the crisis in the sugar cane industry."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive time because they were received."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene reminds one of the fact that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a subject for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests have no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the congregation saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero. "</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began."</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently."</seg>

<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do it with hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres for 2014 to teach young groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree Communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop begins with the fact that the young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance "or whatever they come to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears, on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases were not solved."</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences through globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our shout</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"thus, they can grow and as well as our youth go forward"</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have destined for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comments section, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also contribute and adds the verse to silo script (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Aesthetic Models of the dishes" ") of any dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi there are a lot of these small companies, which produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile phones decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food supplements is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, a Kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you can view more bizarre plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the Hashtag #," "Greatest" "in the world."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the extremists and oestments regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" dealing with drug trafficking ") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs every weekend according to his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" as every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to my father's insurance, but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where are we going to get here? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I pass on newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or look at it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the 'heroic deeds' of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"it is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "soaking." ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was pillaged with threats, "she describes how armed criminals held money from her business month for month until they destroyed the business, but also tore her family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as they do not know when they will be kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these awful days I asked if wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the response is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, warm tortillas and make" chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody pse of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was violated by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office had 3103 murders."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DRC and Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated, the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"public officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theater near, which was full of people who looked at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and corpted corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to mischief.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture titled" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident make up the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of stolen bodies, which are lined up on the ground while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo has been zoomed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram fighters attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and shrubs.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to number corpses," "said a citizen of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were shattered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated with satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo came up again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"even one step further, personal comments such as this example falsely mislead the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning alert, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee attacks, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following were shown, bringing these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page which falsely claimed to be President Myanmar's Thein Sein, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. additionally, she had used the image of the DR Congo to cover this information."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">"there are two strong themes or frames (frameshes), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in regard to greater discussions about the silence related to the murderings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal coincides with the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitized and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used detached from context or completely abusive."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico. the march started at the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Ciudad's Front for the Noise Testing of Debt) and the Comenial Church Assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the restructuring of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are liable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be blackmailing and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "an independent non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBSP campaign was dedicated."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, published books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available for royalty free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge, and what the real costs are with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the Adra prison directory, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current status or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the detention of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "Bassel had taken part in the military court of his cell in Adra on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Siegel, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more provisionally than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, in order to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, embodying this architecture not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent all my life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read and write English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prose that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace,"</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under assault by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"since 2011, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">"today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption convicted by corruption, post office release again on previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger, Mozambique reacted to corruption in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council presided over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who issued the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with the German Wave:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the refutation.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disproportionate. ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be re-integrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director does not have any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself only by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machu, that a thief is in jail:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censuses many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or gap-bse."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or" "Placement" "in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call itself hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people reported that also posts, in which they discussed the use of the word, have been censored for its use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before fighting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facebooks.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words that are next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, the hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the campaign may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to extinguish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I prohibited the liking, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail" didn't meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before starting the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like" chair "or" hereditary curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided for a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not include hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"post saying" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to further heat the violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"for its failure, Facebook has been criticized for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese pages."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censing the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the Inter-Religious Organization (IRO), a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as the age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as, every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"UN statistics for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish laws of child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Senator Clarence Rambhaat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and not a single vote against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on the children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has used too much time and unnecessary talk, which conceals the core of the matter, but you know what? the children toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price."</seg>

<seg id="1365">"Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:"</seg>

<seg id="1367">"the draft for the amendment of the law was adopted today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has closed the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law (Nr. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to be locked, multiple mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are now surfaced."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content, however, is available in spite of the legal ban."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blogpost, IPFS reports on its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the ban on Wikipedia), we all decided to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to check out at least all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar folders when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed-out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"he described on Facebook, how he helps him in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live on the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage."</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was located and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune Nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know that because he stood face to face tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Neptune Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice is alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian State of Odisha by a fake court and violated by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not name their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have far less legal advice to fear, if any, they should not come up with this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, performed a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years, Rohini Payer has been working with her video camera to detect practices, such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing the Rohini in its discussion was of women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she chose this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak out loud in the name of their husbands, is a custom that they owe all liability and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this will be regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everyone," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition where married women can never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only kicked out during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustrated frustrations against him and his family by curbing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"over the next few days, Rohini obtained a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put to the woman: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never been so honest about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a salami-kurta, a wide shirt over a pant; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of discussion and discussion about the merits of its own choice of dress, morals combined with saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since its initial discussion, Rohini confirms that things are coming slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of them, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of dress - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience it, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and the result was that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man can contain gold, or can bring wealth, declared the police officer of Zambézia of the BBC."</seg>

<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the prosecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Morrumbala district, province of Zambézia, for presumably abused rituals, has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique in discord (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, generating wealth."</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(endangering the State) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which demanded democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and said a spokesman, he did not consider it necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China still receives calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavaliero accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist the logic" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are not a country in the end."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" "normal" "countries, in view of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretended to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried appropriate questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point provided that he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the critics point out that one should start reading the entire script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" Be no country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassing..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes that, and is aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "faithfully commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian advocate?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the Cabinet of Cabinet, statements by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but they only defend their city, but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to Bejahung, Singapore, and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many Singaporean...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies such as" "the defense of the country in particular", "but that is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1788">"take a look at these photos of the video, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico," Mama Afrika "is home to migrants on their long journey"</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula and is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59 year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells us that people come to full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it's rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication which they cannot pay, she massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mother Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) poses with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes, he answers with a smile." I really feel that it suits her, as African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, it's normal to make a first stop in South America and then pull north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that the Africans have already spoken to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet worked in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will be in contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are left to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez may well be known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single mother, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later the family still lives there, trying to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travellers should consult their telephones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandma, she leaves many photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair lichens, who made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya I fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users at the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" prevents access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app is designed to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notifications about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on users' experiences in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit the unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme engravings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet based on Twitter" images from mainland China "(" "International Ministries" "), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents at random, whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are found at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China have also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computer and mobile phones are connected to electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all branches of government, government and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities issued a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards "at the local police station."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis, three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" "sleep or death", "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where all important things have disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identifiable, both from the inside and from the outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"one, who gives honour to their name."</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has knocked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform into beings out of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts come up in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even when the earth turns on on the axis of the unholy. it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone built around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"during a peaceful protest, five youths were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" cries.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the districts sought, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I did not put high demands on a city that has been stuffed to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calmed down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I interrupted the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a glorious image that filled my expectations with full satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp, but it just doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screwed it all the way to the office of the Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel of Ghassan was there with several of his men, my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel of Ghassan begins to speak:" let me hear how you cry "Allahu Akbar," or you are courageous enough to scream when we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you trust me to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure in my case when I answered: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father equally with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"like his father, right away."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The smell of this cursed sentence is still in my nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture, which I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I screamed the court.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"after that, through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I give me all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with only one more prisoner, and I am allowed to contact me immediately without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the bureaucrat left the cell, and I resorted to an ancient method of communication: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell-fin was a" "first respite". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after a long hesitation, he finally answered me."</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle-aged man who looks similar to me and is called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive facial features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Maybe he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator had assured me that they would leave him, if I remain."</seg>
<seg id="2048">A liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have had a scarecrow to drive out all these crows that labelled on the fruit in my head's garden.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from the distance I still hear them" "Allahu Akbar" "screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the colour of calamity until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror in person: the Raad (for example:" "thunder", "reference to 13th Sure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - thus they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the narrow vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house that is not a land; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he will come to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant conversation, "in spite of the expressions that derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am accustomed to not answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can no longer tell exactly when insults and punches become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate confession.</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him and you can't hold back your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator used to work as a garbage collector before or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable, from their point of view."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them alternated while I was still in the ranks."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and did not really enjoy it, which is why it was next to an electrically loaded rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to store my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say it was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which occurred to me like a few minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" "my Lord, my Father has to worry about terrible troubles."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and move, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>

<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam in a hot young day."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary representatives who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsänger Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert hall."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"s & D Spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that issue the well-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely not simply to be shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'Honorrors' has increased in Jordan, which is left unofficial."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, it was aggravated that Jordan lacked institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a 1954 anti-crime law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" indefinitely be held in prison, "and for their release, many times of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee are often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is well-known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been infiltrated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" Santorano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse frequently repeats itself:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equal opportunities of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were ripped, twisted and reviewed in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib openly promotes the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nude, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nude, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, as Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service firmly accepted several former government decrees and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they would have been critical of the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial forms of democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the wagons, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outside appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressers."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the exuberant hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has resulted in more and more regular citizens entering the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to receive training in the hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year starting in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Courtesy. use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question came to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrillas who have lived in illegal camps for many years have been exposed to war rhetoric and, around the clock, wore their weapons, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's aim is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued, to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt travelled to the camp to personally overtake the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they had previously done to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "said Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an associate of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer them."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the garnet."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has impacted upon the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would prevail after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milashina in Novaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a translator, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Tschetschenen had learned about the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the long run."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day someone told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a Transformer who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you cry? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had taken everything together and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two sms in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which case were you laid, in which of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they posed absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad news and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother got too much, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, there was a car with dark windows and a plate plate with a 95 on top."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without recording me, without knowing anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I received a message:" "you don't believe you would be safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a topic of taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with the camera, I really try to look like the person she looks like from her past - so to my male shape."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed dortted?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask for evidence that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced satisfaction through blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many people.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kadyrow's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be present later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us closer to" "civilisation", "but in the end we were thrown back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia never hurt me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed that you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about women's behaviour."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"whoever laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the worsening of the situation in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I discovered these people myself, when I clipped them off."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"nature, that has nothing to do with religion at all."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be exact, different attitudes."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, Ahwazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hanged."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless because of persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>

<seg id="2423">"the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians, emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and thus be hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi had to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminine * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, today, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still runs through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is known to me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I'm talking about skin color, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices "and" "Kumbaya, my lord" "to reach equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about sexualised violence, in addition to sexualised violence, an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold manner."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and home places earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can't join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a demented and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings which, in addition to cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender, because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clumsa Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) refers to the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither skipped nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship was a little time past and the police said their statement would be laid to the files, but nothing can be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman, Balbuena, was shown for abuse, Ada Báez's well-informed ad was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women publish advertisements in general, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who mistreate them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must notify the prosecution authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strips and Statistics 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that is not underscoring Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are actually mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are different data and reports which do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available numbers are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads were filed for domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts. here, 86% of women's ads came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women claimed that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's ministerial Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "9 women who do not do this are reported to every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of mental mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this," she declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2508">I would never have thought I would once become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") composed of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# sovereign)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NGOs) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare femicidal to an individual criminal offence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the text of the law was changed in some respects to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalization of abortions is banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay, and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foreseen that most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which the victims of violence must be borne by themselves, if they simply want to refund and receive a secure lodging to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the prosecution of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must repay as long as mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been amended, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information," on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn. "</seg>
<seg id="2547">"more than a year ago, the Arab authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn due to their reporting on corruption in the sultant."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in jail where he served a one-year sentence."</seg>
<seg id="2549">"two other editors from Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were arrested and tried again later."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="2551">"since then, along with his role as the only sultan, he laments the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"the Sultans' rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, public freedoms, including press freedom, limiting and imprisonment of human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities are systematically limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and preventing citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"on 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, was arrested after an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title" "High-ranking parties tied hands of the judiciary". ""</seg>

<seg id="2560">"on 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the Editorial Board, was invited to the special department at ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"on 9 August 2016, the ISS took the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris arrest."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"the paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that" the publication and distribution of the newspaper was forbidden in any way, including online, from 9 August 2016. "</seg>
<seg id="2563">"on 26 September 2016 the first trial was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri."</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">"al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, for disturbance of the public order," abuse of the Internet "and" undermining the prestige of the state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2566">"in addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slander."</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fines of 3000 US dollars each (7800 US dollars) and a one-year ban on professional ban against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"for Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 US dollars was fixed (13,000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Judgement of Judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"the Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari."</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month sentence from the prison prison. al-Haj remains in prison where he served his first sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"despite the decision of the Court to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the US government."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"on 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of" Azamn "was extended by three months."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"on 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information has personally signed a further statement in which the closure of" Azamn "was extended by three additional months and with what the Minister filed another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to re-publish the publication of the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman the press freedom has been violated in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">"further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2578">"due to the continuing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press."</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj promptly and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with its consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research to be carried out on site: on the one hand there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research conducted by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">AGA: what do you think of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being creators themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often unusable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because the financing and chances of development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines can only be made available for payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky first appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security concern the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a century-old tradition, Morton still breeds Salad, but it takes longer because his work is more and more difficult due to ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"we have to do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" "Open Source" "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have bred red roasting salat of the variety OutredGorgeous in the" "greenhouse" "of the station and tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the move from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the use of other seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." "open source" "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sowing - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the profited professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bridging seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "open source" "movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says, and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered for example on farmer's markets."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material that is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has been employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only aggravated."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that large-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. currently, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is other breeders, because" patents and the protection of plant-varietal innovations promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to achieve the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not hinder innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is perfectly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such, which move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, also without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years," he says. "with a patent for 20 years, you are protected from competition with what you think it's pretty easy." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements an open source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it contradicts the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"a statement, however, is not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" "Open Source" "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" "open source" "seed systems for planning the official start-up next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly focused on where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2736">"I managed to convey the feeling of a siege to me; arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"afte also documented the blocking of providers, through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that the Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is further aggravated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis using which it can proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Thieves robbed the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airstream to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice has even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the newspaper" Extra "known for detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which she announced to set up a new column called" war in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"more will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the" "War in Rio" "section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the paper continues to write:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then raises questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than they use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a" war "argues."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as showed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2780">"for years, Globo, the largest media company in South America, has been particularly well-known to the company Globo, which, like Cecília, has been emphasizing the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"this security policy also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit installed by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing one unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports about harassment and repression against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux lectured from one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also results in serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"for this, penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" "collateral damage" "and" "lost balls". ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police clothe the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly severely affected, where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged by rebel forces outside of Damascus, leading to the need for local residents to be transported on local or through tunnels and checkpoints."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not part of the traditional, planted food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose the cultivation of mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that it has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more" familiarity. ""</seg>

<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila zu Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with" "production of fungal seeds originating from regions," "before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms all over the East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also recorded in the Galician region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts, spreading out in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European Forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the federal government of Portugal declared Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open rear door so that everything could be built," says João Sorval in the same article of the paper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, are spreading like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and in October this fateful weekend was so crucial that the servers were not able to stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million people."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars, who were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high rates of money. however, it is true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organization" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "suffers from a general lack of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which, after the application of the asylum application, can still go for months."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible lifestyles helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"a lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, a number of Afghans operated companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the restaurant's menu tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Ashark's goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>

<seg id="2925">"Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a Kabul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity stand."</seg>

<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years."</seg>
