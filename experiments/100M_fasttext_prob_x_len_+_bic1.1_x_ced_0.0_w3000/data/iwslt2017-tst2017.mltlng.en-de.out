that &apos;s James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en ris@@ ked the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; all of a sudden , although they have been stating for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government on ris@@ ers were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly procu@@ red his telephone conversations , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit exchange , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower coming to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet existed as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , who has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to take away mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental worker , the alarm for contaminated water from Flin@@ t hits . or a Wall street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week , we were sent from news of a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of childhood days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous on the next release and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent shri@@ ller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do something ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some very few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans who came in these revelations expos@@ ing this scandal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states , less information is needed , less information must be given to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allows employees of school districts to rip off school children .
&quot; che@@ ers are allowed to rip off , especially vulnerable investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot;
it may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that a lot has started to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been collecting central registers on a national level who really lies behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US hin@@ ders here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliam@@ ents , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who will get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a sale of the farm . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in town and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; when we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at my toes to the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs in his class@@ rooms today . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came to life .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we would like to offer investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit is over . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite foreign people to stay overnight . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get into the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Art Academy we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design be such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; for example , most guests feel like they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please tell Twitter that he is the president of the president ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name , if he had told where he came from , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 evaluations that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked cell phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
not surprisingly we trust people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell us too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; there is too much to tell , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I do holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write about .
all of our company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is just going very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
&quot; fortunately , there was only one fraction per share of the 123 million overnight stays . &quot;
for people have confidence in one another .
&quot; if trust works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is its assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attack due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save lives even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want one to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled across this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
&quot; but now simply to call it &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling was a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighborhood that you &apos;ve never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments for the purpose of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing together ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a lead
&quot; were given to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did it work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual human , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my he@@ address . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : it was a feminist declaration of independence for me at that time , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock rapidly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t miss you . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week in@@ doors .
&quot; then it became Friday in that week -- the day , on which Muslims gather for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims in the open and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have seized the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love issues . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people saying , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is mis@@ placed .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; there may be some parking lots , but don &apos;t stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised into mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has noticed that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one raises a glance at them , it does not force what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing , and something that would make sense of their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised them a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit messages to test persons in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims flow@@ ed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to raise the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dentist &apos;s faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother made such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think@@ ers with a drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception rather than the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am no exception in any respect .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air packing in our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; by connecting them , air@@ tools reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build resili@@ ent structures independently .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence , and in general react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called stern starter , &quot;
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star @-@ runners , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star @-@ whis@@ pers it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position can be re@@ gained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside living things happen very much , so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in thri@@ ft , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
moving in the room in all directions no matter in which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see it .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller drops , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , though limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us the salary is in development and creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; three billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , and so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first .
more than 1.3 billion years ago there was just a number of people living on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ ddy -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance . &quot;
this is why we now call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last trial run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes were scre@@ ened through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot;
a wave of gravity is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and thrust into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often teach in courses on theory of rel@@ ativity a really al@@ berian dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stu@@ ffed at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus , which is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and , with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in sounds , it &apos;s different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her , &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range . &quot;
&quot; so when we turn wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to hear , recognis@@ es this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s briefly think about what that means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we &apos;ve heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because they are opa@@ que .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this theme : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o they watch , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to all that I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak sau@@ cer . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there , I always s@@ wore to play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , consider life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days with four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : &quot;
$ 350 million for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not just produced , so even above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it is true when I say that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result , a high sound , delivered a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could drive for ever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with TV production , when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this h@@ um , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a h@@ um , then you cannot strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to do differently than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sums .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land that I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the h@@ um .
am I just this h@@ um ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours days , busy weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me there was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a flagship Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; today , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you do what you do , you love what you are doing , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you already knew the sums , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone any more . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am titanium and my bu@@ zz@@ ing , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing , except watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country that I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a h@@ um . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titanium sl@@ um , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sum is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as good as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work rather than home ? &quot;
&quot; well , yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of them is that I am too relaxed .
&quot; we run around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst into bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always take my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe ful@@ fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever stop playing ?
&quot; you can do it too ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; maybe you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and if my teen@@ age daughter is talking to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just 15 minutes , it doesn &apos;t need more . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad m@@ oods day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers ; dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so thank@@ ful . &quot;
I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country that I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new attitude of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I &apos;m a writer . I think things like that I stir you up to life .
&quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ pl@@ ates an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe qu@@ aking and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas har@@ ms the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a portion of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , decided to analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue section is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to succeed . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you might still be aware of biology lessons , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they still preserved ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we transplan@@ t these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ register the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Professor Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills sector in the motor@@ ised cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of three @-@ dimensional brain mechanisms .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that this was also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them with humans .
I really hope I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take to get to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is f@@ ading with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aking friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy savers and corporations , however , are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sound after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which were lying around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and hu@@ stle the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up , &quot;
&quot; if the circumstances are un@@ inten@@ tional , it will cause the body to kill him . &quot;
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are critical to the rescue of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Palestinian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two took place , by gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ ing them . &quot;
wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not in a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because nowadays it can be in the government and still not in power , because power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of predat@@ ors that have so sustain@@ ably fed the animals from which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste is more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts are deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we should be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labor are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those belonging to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not belonging to the company . no more tu@@ g between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scar@@ ce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , globally Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive drop in total economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the 19th century England . &quot;
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake historically considered .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the 19th century , it smells like hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive fault line has passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; it is true . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , have still chosen denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but when change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you anticipate ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring down our government simply because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they have been implementing a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where after having looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average exer@@ tion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon puts things out for free , is it possible to access correctly ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and result in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give to shows their course of shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com more than four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the minimum thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we are more and more used to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one will ever come into contact with this software in this room . come into contact , you are in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , a bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ inable lots of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you disman@@ tle this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items back together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and reason , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like House of Cards , that was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is telling us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for making decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will try it later with a technical demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
