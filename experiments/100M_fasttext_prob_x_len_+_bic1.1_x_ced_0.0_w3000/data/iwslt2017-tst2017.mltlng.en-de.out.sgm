<seg id="1">That's James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen risked the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"all of a sudden, although they have been stating for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government on risers were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly procured his telephone conversations,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit exchange, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet existed as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, who has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to take away misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental worker, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint hits. or a Wall street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week, we were sent from news of a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of childhood days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous on the next release and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent shriller or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some very few to hide and obscure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans who came in these revelations exposing this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states, less information is needed, less information must be given to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US allows employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"cheers are allowed to rip off, especially vulnerable investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult."</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very cloudy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen incidents of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been collecting central registers on a national level who really lies behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US hinders here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us in Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency that allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after finishing my design studies, I made a sale of the farm."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in town and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"when we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "where are you sleeping tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get in there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed at my toes to the door, and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs in his classrooms today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I thought about how we could make something for it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such a "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and fell into the castle, Brian and me stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to life.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we would like to offer investors:" we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit is over. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite foreign people to stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get into the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Art Academy we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"for example, most guests feel like they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name, if he had told where he came from, like his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 evaluations that all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell us too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"there is too much to tell, for example:" I have problems with my mother -- "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"there is therefore an optimal degree of openness, such as" "great works of art in your apartment! I do holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write about.</seg>
<seg id="193">All of our company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a demand that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business is just going very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there was only one fraction per share of the 123 million overnight stays."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who can save lives even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want one to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled across this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to call it" rental industry, "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling was a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighborhood that you've never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments for the purpose of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of sharing together?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a lead</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual human, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headdress."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: it was a feminist declaration of independence for me at that time, compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...,"... "in the name of Islam...,..."... "jihad...,..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the United States to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't miss you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it became Friday in that week -- the day, on which Muslims gather for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims in the open and beat.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have seized the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I don't have any questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people saying," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be some parking lots, but don't stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised into mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radicalization process, one has noticed that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from her church, even from her family, so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one raises a glance at them, it does not force what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing, and something that would make sense of their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists, who promised them a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit messages to test persons in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims flowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to raise the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dentist's faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has my brother made such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packing in our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting them, airtools reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence, and in general react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called stern starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other star-runners, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the star-whispers it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside living things happen very much, so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospinner is an exercise in thrift, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions no matter in which direction it is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller drops, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, though limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the salary is in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"three billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, and so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago there was just a number of people living on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly muddy -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why we now call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last trial run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes were screened through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life's work."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and thrust into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers often teach in courses on theory of relativity a really alberian dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stuffed at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus, which is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and, with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in sounds, it's different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "now Alice is talking." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her,"</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we turn wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] Anyone who knows what to hear, recognises this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which rotate as quickly as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of whom we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this theme: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo they watch, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I experimented with an experiment."</seg>

<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," changed my life. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes," "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "kittens" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak saucer."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there, I always swore to play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, consider life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days with four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes:"</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not just produced, so even above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fancier, and it is true when I say that it's not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, a high sound, delivered a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could drive for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's what she does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with TV production, when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this hum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a hum, then you cannot strive for size differently."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to do differently than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make one clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land that I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the hum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this hum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours days, busy weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a flagship Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "today, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you do what you do, you love what you are doing, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you already knew the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone any more. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am titanium and my buzzing, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing, except watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a hum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titanium slum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as good as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work rather than home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of them is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we run around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fulfills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can do it too! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me naive, for a day dreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and if my teenage daughter is talking to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it's just 15 minutes, it doesn't need more."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad moods day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the sums, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzzing, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers; dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so thankful."</seg>
<seg id="778">I have never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new attitude of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things like that I stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said," "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implates an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuitry of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from severe quaking and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain traumas harms the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a portion of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, decided to analyze the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue section is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François was able to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"you might still be aware of biology lessons, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they still preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-planted them at the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we transplant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-register the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Professor Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills sector in the motorised cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of three-dimensional brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand side, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that this was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take to get to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is fading with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaking friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are brighter, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy savers and corporations, however, are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US Dollar sound after a lot of money until it compares with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which were lying around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and hustle the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"if the circumstances are unintentional, it will cause the body to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are critical to the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy based on these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive aspect of the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of the state concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Palestinian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two took place, by gradually undermining politics and escaping them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because nowadays it can be in the government and still not in power, because power has migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that have so sustainably fed the animals from which they nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste is more sublime, and social conflicts are deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which lets the film" Matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of" matrix, "in which machines serve human beings and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we should be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labor are completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those belonging to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not belonging to the company. no more tug between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "into units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive drop in total economic demand, which Larry Summers described as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the impression of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I can say this provocatively, China is similar to the 19th century England."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the 19th century, it smells like hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say good-bye to complacency, and the continuous denial that a massive fault line has passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is true. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have still chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might delay it for a while, but when change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government simply because they didn't want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been implementing a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"if it does not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930 that it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive to where after having looked at a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average exertion, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon puts things out for free, is it possible to access correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and result in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give to shows their course of shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they took a venture and decided not to make a sitcom more than four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minimum thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we are more and more used to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one will ever come into contact with this software in this room. come into contact, you are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis outbreaks of flu, a bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you dismantle this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items back together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and reason, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like House of Cards, that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," "This is telling us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for making decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
