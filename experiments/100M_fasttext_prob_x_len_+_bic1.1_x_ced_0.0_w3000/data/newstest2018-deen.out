Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is now excav@@ ated .
little gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it gets annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get excited about it was because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very insi@@ ghtful . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a carpet of pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognise as such .
&quot; more detailed maps were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called ur@@ anium leaves . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops finally removed the Lun@@ é@@ ville peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbors , who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying . &quot;
the prototype for Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
the comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded to all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , ie 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ writing numbered cor@@ rid@@ ors from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots of land today no longer occupy farmers - but farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and not a concrete pit in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the judgment sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the gas &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , finished buying the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East lies west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in terms of bombing . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where the ground @-@ breaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen &apos;s rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ coloured has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for African @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special care when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped because of their skin colour , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report issued by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white ones . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring deposits or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the country &apos;s 16th position . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local prosec@@ uting authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U on further racial pro@@ stitution . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the electric fence project is spontaneous
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ mag@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac gave themselves a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ place association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday branches . &quot;
&quot; for him , &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative market@@ able path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
exclusively region@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; as he is also the chairman of Fischer@@ bach &apos;s B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep faces .
&quot; the green area provides a lot of work , much must be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not conduct a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hect@@ are , farmers should be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their business , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
&quot; because of the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area is 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be listed until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 71 500 were supported by Leader , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape conservation line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area may not be tu@@ g@@ able ( incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at present , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build just under 16 km of fence , is currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Hof Dec@@ oration Project 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate it as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have heard him if he had done it .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem that you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who long to breathe freely , / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable garbage &quot; on our screens was better seen .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s meaning .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical ima@@ gery .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a quite different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
&quot; and , of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ches should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ ts belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the intermediate runner Mu@@ ir goes on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1500 m , is another gr@@ otto that one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a big honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there .
blocking Cri@@ tics via Facebook : do not work around a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating up of voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before the papers struck him for all , from domestic politics to political principles . &quot;
&quot; he shr@@ ank in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington declared : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; this is a Repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has established a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ em his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum which is called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , reflective and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also appreciate this idea if a number of people take up the same issue , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective assignment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor staff referred to as a &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical supplies , or to arrest or sil@@ enced demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question happened last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain were overwhel@@ med by his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led up links to the final round last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it .
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad how it went so far .
&quot; the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ine are with the trio on the field . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew ol@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free of charge , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are attributed to passive smoking , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were about 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; is in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; says the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected because there is a lot of snow in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is constantly imp@@ eding the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red traffic lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular service buses are entitled to drive through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indon@@ esian Gold Country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shelf in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken out and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was shot in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public lifting in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which was stirring for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with around 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were converted by rust in various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ anti@@ cide and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua of wood resources are valued at US $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly $ 20 million , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists more than 500,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ ies were genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; in a report from the year 2016 Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e , reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim business mig@@ rations from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native land , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - cost their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of the rights in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but Papua has changed little , and today the locals are feeling che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , anticip@@ ating that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; You say . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the attack on her tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ cs and led the Wa@@ ita dance - running in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; they say in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ v@@ i held a fer@@ vent speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for three weeks , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he would establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism to supplement historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; who called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ tus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so panic that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and to withdraw the police bri@@ gade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble producer for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Papua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native land and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; in spite of this , Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the victims of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never give them justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ tus says with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the Dubai sky@@ scra@@ per for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest housing towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) by chance . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units replaced the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , and cooled the building . &quot;
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted in the fact that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposed Davis Cup single was only supported by two @-@ thirds majority for the Sport Revolutionary proposal . &quot;
&quot; this often very long , but also very appreciated five @-@ sentence classic will therefore be preserved to the traditional value . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the applications .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to complete the final at a neutral location . &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the following year .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US Travel@@ ers brings prohibited items into the plane , finding out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the plane while in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently carrying out forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also discovered that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of Mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X . &quot;
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security screening , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents affir@@ med that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs to the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , who most often smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to share with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customer has already withdrawn her non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ vial figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k reported for the first time a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Mus@@ k frequently had over 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k is now dre@@ aming : 6@@ 3.000 orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , but Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth goals is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a Model 3 today should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the liability of the reservations for Tes@@ la could be a problem . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a time limit which expi@@ red on 1 October for States , in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly went over to block or delay regulations , which oppose chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ gs regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be prosec@@ uted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious .
&quot; however , the EPA statement said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .

&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who filed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;

Tum@@ ble celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and sponsors Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it &apos;s a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customiz@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei at the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the testimony of the certificate , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ te Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be recognized today in the village image of Tum@@ lings , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to the year 1600 prove this historical situation .
the right to pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to appoint a pastor or to suggest a new pastor to the Bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater the two sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but was later released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used it as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the bell tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; for the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers have a fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant which is important for Tum@@ ble and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association has invited Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the remaining urban area . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government was not approved by the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be accepted , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval of the district government is still pending .
&quot; explan@@ atory : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; since last week , the corresponding letters have been dealt with at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes them as an occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally injured .
two other people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car accompanied her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and tra@@ der planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ theim and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; the commercial association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to attract the inhabitants to the shopping expedition into the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ tise customers to what offers the own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; thus , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre invite for &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the promotion aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , are Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; as a result , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; for the well @-@ filled Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts to move them into active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to help anim@@ ate the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , had said in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third country @-@ wide &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine further injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ gade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a last in critical condition . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
&quot; a first miss was later found dead , too . &quot;
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a cause of failure , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people were staying in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump placed under pressure after en@@ visi@@ oned tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; the US president accused him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the U.S. refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cries broke the silence when a young black man was pulled down from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post@@ age . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the throat of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience got very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
since 2005 citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was not a single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of the Nach@@ stellung . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents a yearly reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician puts a blanket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on a loose foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black colour laughter Roger Mal@@ col@@ m had a white landed propriet@@ or , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white Land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got closer to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , concluded an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is based on a kind of deep racism which many would like to believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ der for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ leng@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and presses him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ v@@ elling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a mourning @-@ dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gy oppres@@ sive moisture every nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks walks on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same land , where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; said a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ hid hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms . the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at one table a white couple from Atlanta ch@@ ats excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what I really do with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds a court at his table , he eats and recalls civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sk@@ ul@@ fed street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhein@@ fat@@ chter will pose as a rock productive , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which goes through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rh@@ en@@ ish daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in the Hollywood @-@ style , run a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when Siegfried was frigh@@ tened .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my times , which hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to leave a bell concert about himself , five years later , great jubil@@ ation , in which the occasional &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls were interrupted . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of its perception . &quot;
I prefer a positive resume .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at the school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
amount : I did a high school diploma .
&quot; and then a civil engineering course , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; take a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social sciences . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Youth Wel@@ fare Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing his FS@@ J .
one can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
&quot; in other words , studying civil engineering ? &quot;
&quot; a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in front , who each have a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked out of the family , must always respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts up another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut down its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , are in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost reduction programme to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , divided Nato &apos;s declaration . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bus bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack in the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump balances the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul , over the past few weeks , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA inver@@ ts decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a portion of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , aims to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els concludes the establishment of a common room in the future senior citizens residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing plot is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; while the church community has so far been part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are ho@@ vering , such a common space not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ental home , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ it@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget already in the past autumn will be made , by means of funding . &quot;
the building is in the area of refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect , one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ - and the building &apos;s roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , this is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so much forward , you can now rest at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
&quot; it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy of wealthy , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real counter @-@ value in the case of doubt , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; according to the proposal , Sta@@ ir@@ er &apos;s motion to meet the proposed resolution finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cyclists are thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath is captured by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction gave priority to him .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder hit the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting car .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel matters , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the sta@@ ff@@ ing staff at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti only has to ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ oses Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
in the resin from star to star mig@@ rate to star
&quot; the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas &quot; &quot; ( Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) is planning this . &quot;
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information for many people . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to draw tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be complemented by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of the site . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star path will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path the viewer will learn much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star appears more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is much farther away . &quot;
&quot; in which con@@ stellation I find a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with the naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g Planet@@ arium in the university town of Göttingen , like the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the down@@ gra@@ ded Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distant sun is at least 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fixation , however , would last for half a year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a potential show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting pit@@ stop in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former body@@ weight , &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I rose up for Bron@@ er , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light wei@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also had interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23rd . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed his willingness to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that Ri@@ ver@@ side &apos;s triple fight champion is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show the punch strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could sense the momentum , which was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after pun@@ ctu@@ ation
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the start of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the start of the season against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result too , wouldn &apos;t have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that was too much for two opponents , and we have to work better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the tri@@ pple is to be further optimised . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a breach , the for@@ tun@@ ics also don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better right after the experiences in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ ising and we don &apos;t do so many playing mistakes in building up . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about an un@@ decided start from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and be able to concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; I first judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can practically start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at present , &quot; says the Fort@@ una winner . &quot;
&quot; the guests from the Rhin@@ eland , as an easy favourite on Sunday , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det sought out the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is poor is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport at the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three needs to be rehabil@@ itated between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges run through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven @-@ ton@@ ne so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
&quot; this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
&quot; on top of that , the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collective farm in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light lane . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridge renovation costs amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , F@@ WG ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein city hall R@@ ond@@ ell for the &quot; &quot; great campaign kick @-@ off &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally planned , the city picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A world and one of the most influential organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including an &quot; age @-@ German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually arrive at Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel reports that he has stri@@ ved for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ t there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ er@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is what it does : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the audi@@ torium , waiting for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can shut down - no special incidents .
trumpet meets trumpet
&quot; a hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos Tom@@ orrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ oth@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R symph@@ ony orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like this in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the N@@ ils W@@ ogram Jazz Award , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating piece of art . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ably the most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I was using . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about it , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I have always been living du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot;
it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school age she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to explain their love life to the public : &quot; people expect you to react in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today , I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business . &quot;
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee gave an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would hin@@ der us from working again to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E praised &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who have won gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Con@@ gres@@ sional Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found clu@@ es to state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still active , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; mourning ceremony for soldiers , crashed in Mali &quot;
&quot; during a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ resolved cause of the fall . &quot;
&quot; she described the two inver@@ ted drivers , however , as &quot; experts of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , the closest friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen called the inver@@ ted soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ ged . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fighter jet Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers were , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the commitment was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are paid , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this was divided by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen cons@@ ented with the decision of her husband , and it was said further in the message . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also de@@ votes the title of &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , declared L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the head of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ crat , Mar@@ gre@@ the had met in London in 1965 . &quot;
&quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 years of reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope in for@@ bear@@ ance . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke out for the dissolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the unexpected exit of a Green Party MP from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes @-@ majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ erns founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to vote on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s confidence and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be properly examined by law , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in silence , one will discuss all the questions if they are legally pru@@ dent . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous de@@ pu@@ ties to return their agricultural trade .
&quot; it goes without saying that , with immediate effect , the regional president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared their land trade with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; also against the background , that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Trans@@ action of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party MP El@@ ke T@@ owns to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the Australian exit costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and frustr@@ ates her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty domestic game and tries to beat political capital from it .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
&quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests to counter@@ f@@ eit the outcome of the country &apos;s election in 2013 with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the day before the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will introduce the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for the consumer .
trade has as well as the manufacturers ensure that the sold @-@ out products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
&quot; if the residual hardness of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage based on alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the event of a serious incident . &quot;
is it only missing at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a full explanation from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get only safe and traffic @-@ resistant food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the firm means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the F@@ TT &apos;s financial rules impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization monitoring the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be tens of tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make money easy , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and brings it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of Q@@ at@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be counter@@ ed with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business related to the football . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , which had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked trying to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current 3 @-@ year FF@@ P expansion period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to frigh@@ ten off excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid out the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat @-@ rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which later lowered to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be am@@ bass@@ adors and easily find out such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not competent to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
it becomes very difficult to respect the financi@@ el Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country .
Swiss is looking for a new global supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order . &quot;
&quot; on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current plans , the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed cho@@ ke panels to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders appreciate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
&quot; like many applicants , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not at@@ tain@@ able for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
Swiss took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline is working with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long haul flights , the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also distributed on the short circuit , both in business and economy class . &quot;

&quot; his brother , Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , had failed in the national championship ex@@ cre@@ tion and could only look at the disc@@ us competition from the grand@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meters wide , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge period ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is also a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it had an original story for a promising lot of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle age play cool children , who are grown up - they nevertheless managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character is rum@@ ma@@ ged by an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that might heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be du@@ bbed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tags for viewing ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ af Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes a decent play &apos; Find the Voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef regularly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
hit against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office Con@@ stance announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the process , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officers ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and hundreds of thousands of euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officers from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , Italian citizens were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang . &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the immigration center register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; serious mal@@ decisions &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis carried out by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the details , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the Register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data was not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 were found in individual cases , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such false orders led to a distorted debate on how to deal with ex@@ chan@@ gers , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , it is said that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF leads such proceedings &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the Left Ques@@ tion in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ g@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten the lack of reception conditions in the Italian asylum system and a risk of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach made blood donation service available to other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations now . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the community hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is great how our bodies are created for this and we pay homage to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their components . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 Sp@@ ender , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre &apos;s cab has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ berry were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 performed blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mmer , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for an increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alled that in the coming years , interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected from the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw part of Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic stimulus package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that enh@@ ancements would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rise in expectations on interest rates , and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will likely lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is even worse before it gets improved . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent &quot; in@@ comes in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages would be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Ber@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are clam@@ oring for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should fund him . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p has significantly reduced HIV transmission to infection agents .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified in clinics including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as used in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted , targeted and vulnerable , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to bringing HIV in society closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted storage and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height perfect .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand .
&quot; fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the task . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend .
not only was it possible to build a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below .
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer room for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; Er@@ fan explains to the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ wei@@ ghty , so that when you push the door very easily slides . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot;
&quot; they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional tie in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - accounts for about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property valued at $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul asser@@ ts , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of managing some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick during the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ sou@@ ci family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property well to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; Paul &quot; has become bitter about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .

new Chief of Staff Fe@@ eding plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly actually can do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course . &quot;
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information entered into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said to the employees that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television extends decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps on Twitter is under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these fighters know something that we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps of twe@@ ets without their intervention would have included more ignition material .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t send .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators managed to keep him away from him some times , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers , the President for strategic reasons , to provide doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former junk officials say that tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone malicious to the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from t@@ witter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started questioning staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work of the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped for . &quot;
&quot; in this summer , the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action , which follows the winter in the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting to vacation destinations were hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
&quot; 36 of the online spec@@ s have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their failures . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to put into action , since it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to loo@@ t from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we submit our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in the former ambience company company l@@ t@@ d. on 13th of April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues from the local tax were also lost . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
&quot; however , above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building shell containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are undertaken . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything was to become &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer points out . &quot;
&quot; the Lu@@ ise Wald@@ hotel with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to set up precisely on the level of investment .
&quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external installations are also transferred to the front wheel , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigations .
CN@@ N reported that there were already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men were to stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lican Party in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in possible crime incidents and decide whether an indictment is to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand jur@@ ys are also called the Prosec@@ ution . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to be interro@@ gated under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , persons involved in the meeting had been sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump J@@ ared Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , also participated in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller does not shy away in his work , and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; this work , however , usually works in secret , &quot; &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
former FBI Chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after she fired Com@@ ey .
&quot; because of this cra@@ p , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been lou@@ der , he wants to h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ enting on a Senate committee in June , Com@@ ey asked Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n to susp@@ end investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its staff . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ alled president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties , however , want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative designs on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could not be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Antar@@ ctic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg moves in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been loos@@ ened by the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
it is not a danger for people .
&quot; according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakdown of ice caps in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
&quot; until now , the broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f . &quot;
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
&quot; some say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front edge has never moved as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate stands under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
&quot; melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and disp@@ lace ice as much water as it results after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) writes . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , it was disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ file would grow back or fall short in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , so many king@@ f@@ ishers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; during the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees and counting down to the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to withdraw from the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the District Day has passed 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be allocated this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
&quot; together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U aims to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel development and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but also to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the ministry sick or age @-@ related . &quot;
&quot; so , high time to act so that not even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long been responsible for a rotten surprise already in the circle of chal@@ k , when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked to make a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the district administration should aim at the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better for the employees and officials than the tari@@ ff for the public service actually envis@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently dict@@ ated exactly , increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharpen@@ ed the sound of NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warn that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a manner which facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio Italian prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a meeting took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of over@@ stepping on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons , and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any significant changes or obstruc@@ tions to their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the Shel@@ ter in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were more and more asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers had been announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scriptions gave welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers received healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ro@@ ams for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , rather than fighting through the stadium for wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Ga@@ ins inclusive . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognised the first federal li@@ gn@@ ans , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning made 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup hosted the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup in London , where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be seen online by far more often in these markets than to send the German lig@@ aments to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sports , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup will be cont@@ ested at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; like in normal sports , songs have long since become established in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also to exercise their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but fi@@ st@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integrated effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
this is little about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; says the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport race provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a subject , says fi@@ st@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football club associations , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in European comparison , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the society , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
it is not possible to stick to the fact that only football remains as it always was .

&quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states are affected by the scandal surrounding po@@ ison@@ ous eggs . &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and taken all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany .
&quot; in the regi@@ ments , only eggs are to be taken , which demon@@ stra@@ bly contain no fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics , Con@@ rad Roy &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they depl@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be there for eternity , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never be taking part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer to have this single person , with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a coal @-@ mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hang yourself up , jump from a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the fall by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain for the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will give a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; something was different at his place in the cabin , Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the bind on his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told afterwards , after his first mission as Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the deposit would have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach as well .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the professional C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s youth players , de@@ fam@@ ers and just from holidays . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who were chosen to accept the inheritance of Lah@@ m can use a little extra motivation only well .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting formation like the one , who can also take the helm in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe . &quot;
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal started to over@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , trying to get out of the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( collap@@ sed also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy was running in front of the defense , both were sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game setup . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result wasn &apos;t as we had hoped for .
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ accustomed , the Bavarian world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one could see the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best known foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ La@@ dies wishing all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ ary is a quasi @-@ club colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and be@@ fie@@ bert with our ladies .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ ser Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows , after more than one year , in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy , which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest down@@ turn is natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the list of priorities .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 should be the right to construction . &quot;
&quot; the West Bank also plays a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport network . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ bert spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
&quot; as von Wis@@ ser , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves to develop a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros is planned for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce , says : &quot;
&quot; until now , only 29 places have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to adjust knowledge in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than proposed in obtaining national roads . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreement . &quot;
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an opposite reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ backs .
European autom@@ akers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of for@@ fei@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but depar@@ ting at normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former leader of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s winning .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ low fuel saver .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the start of a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective game of game . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft flow@@ ed over the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ d@@ ules of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist he proposed , among other things , illustr@@ ators for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to an end in the six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , rounded Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to his own statements early in the morning , he is still sitting on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as a counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his characters in the 3D film will be appearing on the screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ m . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change in Provence
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted insects , which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great headaches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , which transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney Office was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , who are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating Sin@@ alo@@ a &apos;s violence , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people will be shot at the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was the publication of a interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , who had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hitting the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters liked to be able to publish hard @-@ hitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine of his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best , and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to concern themselves with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong stay away from it .
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters sur@@ vey@@ ed whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs were de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed three major stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous speaker Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é on state expendi@@ tures focused on the governor &apos;s home town .
&quot; and there was a group , which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous occur@@ ren@@ ces in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have watched Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; protests and buildings in organized protests . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book entitled &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who were hiding under a ceiling with organized crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists by the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of their Director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is scar@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer as at once all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a series of shooting fights with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren how@@ ls nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day , when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening figure . &quot;
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the circle of circles between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well preserv@@ ed@@ condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast inside the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or , resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed to ming@@ le better with its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ed@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal to find evidence about his life , including his con@@ served intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank to the sea floor on his back . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin but also retained in three dimensions and retained the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you look just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the marine conservation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin @-@ branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured @-@ plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were about 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured parties . &quot;
&quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot;
a wide range of emergency vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade noted the hall@@ marks of the vehicle operators , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is clu@@ eless in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
&quot; the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected , or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and thereby de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the track record de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought it through the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : you go to the train , invo@@ ke your ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the case of the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat y .
&quot; if the train atten@@ dant is in place Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel safely without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , the DB navig@@ ator simply checks . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; often you have , in any case , but one of the contribut@@ ors does not have all the documents you need to de@@ value online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
other mer@@ gers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the Queen of St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets later in the evening about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police tape and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I was lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgu@@ sting racism , she is no different than the next black female child . &quot;
I feel I would give it a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said , stating that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis presi@@ ded by the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question is Ferr@@ ell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; Ferr@@ ell brought the project closer together with six other locals , followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shot . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in manag@@ erial positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement really is uph@@ eld by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who touched this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone missing but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory , since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery of more customers in the city , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are very happy again and again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
but that should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping list in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether clothing , footwear , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find this unnecessary . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a good weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , as the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall go to during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , when the bit gallery actually comes at some point . &quot;
or does the ghost @-@ bit @-@ gallery already manage to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , doesn &apos;t need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not place any space . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ffs and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as a secret diplom@@ ati@@ cal news about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline reconc@@ iled her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ former and a pioneering dissi@@ dent who was convic@@ ted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with this gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but talked openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ors and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal glasses , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ lement Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Chel@@ ep@@ a &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was published , commanded man &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome sort of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there are also some deep and strong ones at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump carries out a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid circuits he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand @-@ feet of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des following the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological way , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novel . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears with a free spre@@ ader in hand from the United States discipline barracks such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they get cold , they have won , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which clas@@ h like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a nationwide hunt for men is in progress for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who have been looked for as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several eras . &quot;
&quot; a common warning system , published by the police authority of Chicago , states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
she has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Vice @-@ President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ fixing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern to Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ations agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di no longer sells eggs for the time being
this divided the groups of companies .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion that could not be preceded by any health impairment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are to be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pro@@ legs anti @-@ lice repell@@ ents . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , specific groups and demographic groups , staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the board of directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low requirements - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; close to 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; recently , u@@ ber has recently registered as a client . &quot;
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recognised the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships - identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies started to ear@@ nest ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing all funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you do is strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company take no action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointments can cur@@ b and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow your fellow workers , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day , when a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 AM .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it actually length@@ ens their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are scheduled to perform 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ ump on , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a gate post , will not be easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors by third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to Fak@@ ten@@ inspec@@ tors , which may show results of the fact test from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories prior to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to punish h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that a test of the new facts is launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the recognition of the stories of fac@@ tual audi@@ tors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were even there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ valued my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) this seems to be all too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives , and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all its gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising started in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ r@@ ell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a for@@ eigner , always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by getting married rich women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mal@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; on Friday , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) with the revelation of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really &quot; , &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the promotion is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , it is in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f pays off its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five @-@ figure figure .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week too .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presi@@ dency of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in excess . &quot;
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan 169 fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the Movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who allegedly participated directly in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the overthrow attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , the major training in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by another 73@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was pushing back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , was going to be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let NATO get cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts in the Alliance for the readiness of the Turkish army in the after@@ math of the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington am@@ ends the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by spending the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries get green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to clean track for road safety shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been fought over and over again - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
&quot; before the end of the year , the ailing route , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the ski shuttle bus in the long term , construction work will start on the route according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country ad@@ mits to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; said Minister Secretary @-@ State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will be finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Rail@@ ways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly blu@@ ish in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it won &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot , developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , un@@ quiet one of the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something more dense and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their growing popularity , they nonetheless remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
but what crosses the border zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time when the rights of women around the world are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House , who has bo@@ asted to have sexual offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the el@@ ong@@ ated eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the words of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy minds
&quot; it has become a gl@@ ump @-@ era of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate can also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to burst into our filter bags .
&quot; less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps , bringing families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone she knows , including Repub@@ lican kin@@ ship , with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it is noticeable in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day we will no longer be able to rep@@ el his k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lican of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is concerned , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the NYC park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ming music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I fi@@ gured out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience since two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women can walk on it in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have made the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically bur@@ sting , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts on his hand joints , which he had suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first slaughter .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they were too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
&quot; when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful , the risk of his sentence is increased to 15 years . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ thous@@ and@@ ths from F@@ ab and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the vac@@ ations and secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it brood its chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every quarter vessel that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps to teaching aids , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick time is over now , class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , the students are reluct@@ ant to leave their classes because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students had to finish a song of summer time and holiday periods . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ time students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were deta@@ ined for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is currently underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place every one found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they should improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates that are negotiated are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have a &quot; &quot; che@@ ating software &quot; , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but they do not yet have an exact date . &quot;
Daimler told us to write to each person concerned .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions go ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on manufacturers &apos; commitment and political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturers voluntarily do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not have cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advised to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a risk of a massive price deterioration of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
prizes will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would do without participation in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of resources - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her view clearer .
&quot; according to the former president , John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Zentrum is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s urban development master , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written out , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been the mayor of the city . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press interview .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in keeping with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as a lower construction law authority , the applicant has to present appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill this out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the hack@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure of the building office and his employees . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area around are encountered .
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium renov@@ ations are still subject to change . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will bring about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great room for a city engineer . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , it is possible to respond flexibly to many things . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands under monument protection as an ensemble , it is important to have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city engineer is responsible for high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and kept in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , should present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ valuation facilities , municipal property management , urban farm courtyard with building yard and municipal gardening , as well as lower construction law authority including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle thrown on lines : Southern Rail@@ road closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad tracks in the area of Le@@ oben ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport , don@@ ors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum goes out , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the Süd@@ bahnhof ( Süd@@ bahnhof ) could be managed without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger trains arrived on Friday afternoon , two of them covered the long distance . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease may result . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an intoler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus if the same system is working with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doc@@ torate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a type of immune cell supporting tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separately , did not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial cells of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that a color@@ ectal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers let L. Cross grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice and that most of us L. Cross in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potentially , high level of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and achieved only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new civil strike for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , with growing horror , observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach with the head@@ wind . &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprise faction of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the country &apos;s election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green Federal Executive Officer , Michael Kell@@ ner , asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate to Lower Saxony . &quot;
the transfer to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true all at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ de@@ cal message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is facing the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the over@@ stepping of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ rench . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what will happen next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the unexpectedly clear defeat of the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades re@@ ass@@ ented at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that became too , and everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a pi@@ geon , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; the comrades , in the weeks afterwards , strug@@ gled hard again afterwards . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country chief , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did so pretty much wrong what to do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the critic@@ isms for some time now . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to accentu@@ ate accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal parti@@ ality of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
and Schulz does not at all .
&quot; in the meantime , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , how Mrs. T@@ owns puts her own career entry into the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her personality , but has also been elected to parliament on the list of the lower Saxony &apos;s lower @-@ Saxon countries . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , the elec@@ torate agreed : &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal car@@ eers of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ te the election result , &quot; &quot; said Mr Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local core III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg Urban Development informed us on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what had happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been a number of sen@@ sing areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the former renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to further develop the interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabil@@ itative area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country , the rest from the congregation of sens@@ ations . &quot;
how is a re@@ development area created ?
&quot; we are going to continue examining so sh@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest in san@@ iti@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ state programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the period of approval for the funding medium has been running since January 1 , 2017 to April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the survey will only be carried out in the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision is to take place as soon as possible , so that in the coming year it can begin with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; the aim is to assess and determine the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances , when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
there will be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations , and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it works among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information about the size , division and occup@@ ants of a residential space can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; function - whoever comes first , is grinding first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve subsidies for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the audience a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory team at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built @-@ in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the White House advertising costs will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event produced by American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the data of the military , which was left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was displayed next to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire truck and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a question@@ able order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ anding officer . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft performed in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that complain about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy chairman of the White House Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House conducted 58 practice land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget names for the presidential pl@@ ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
unit recorded recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga take part in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss arrives tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel with the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially at the post@@ erior positions I find the crew very good . &quot;

how America can hurt O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress passed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft suggests to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV , jointly with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Care Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat is enormous .
&quot; however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even per Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked upon which of the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the Hit@@ row series of Net@@ fli@@ x will be at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons were confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 enterprises &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;

the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1st September .
r@@ ô@@ le in reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban child@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all delighted . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled .
&quot; the city operates 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ ten year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 hours of the week are eating in the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; lunch , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour @-@ care when children stay until 14 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service starting September 1st : they pre@@ heat the delivered food , supplement it with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food off , clean up and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are double @-@ group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ een @-@ group facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it is all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaning@@ fully .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - previously the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it presented itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people in the educational sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women would be candidates in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot;
the Taliban published threats against a election process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men at the age of 19 and 23 have been trying to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 5@@ pm , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected his request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;

the two young men were subsequently arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern on investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to check for the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow .
&quot; in the future , G@@ MB Scotland said that the company remained silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called for &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently needed for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to the fact that we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff members and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and fully . if our operational processes change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to trigger its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near Catal@@ ans has always done his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the President of the PS@@ G before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer expressed interest in the PS@@ G middle @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
roller kno@@ cked and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder street in front of the property number 30 and caused damage to over 200 euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the control plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 coming towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rails . &quot;
&quot; on the passenger car , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damage , it can be good that the car driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police now ask witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the perpetr@@ ator vehicle , to contact the In@@ spec@@ torate in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the abuse scandal among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication of the German press agency , he expected from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that &quot; double standards &quot; are measured when reporting violence in the dom@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a connected fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; blows were a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; to get ready with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the reminder tape &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer employed by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg presented with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; even with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible when a cathedral @-@ set brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it all at all .
he is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ation or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; you can at best repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or not have taken first notes seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived as literally &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; by virtually all respon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also makes a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotional appeal , which also led to flood breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kn@@ elt with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also drew ear files and drew too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are , of course , dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
one wonders if it is not more about his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope many , who have never understood him , are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report also reported a great deal on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of Sex@@ ual Ab@@ use was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional manner . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen lear@@ ners R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; in terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... boys have opened more urgent or clearer or even more open than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance , could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any involvement . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to the public . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these reluct@@ ant crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; were to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up in the coverage became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is an abuse of the report .
&quot; in fact , it is ne@@ atly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , we say once , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; the report also covers incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly chann@@ elled and mal@@ igned and suffered , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , like most of the witnesses , the theme of &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began establishing himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger strictly shut the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; that the test sentence continues to be practiced in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative media releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit has been crossed . &quot;
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at the time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right here .
&quot; but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ inable at all times , and not for what was done in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the past . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it is finally worked up . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , to drag ear @-@ arrows and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he was strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject matter of testing also come to speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , I don &apos;t mean that he led a tight regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ class institution until then , true cultural am@@ bass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , one makes no big singers from un@@ ru@@ ly boys and stands before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you see Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work in the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep @-@ believing and warm @-@ hearted people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his vom@@ iting , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lovely respect son , to whom they still look and worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are methods of education that were at the time of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intent behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps no one else could know Germany &apos;s Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , at last in peace . &quot;
