<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now excavated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Little gardeners are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get excited about it was because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very insightful."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a carpet of patchwork that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"more detailed maps were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities, so-called uranium leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally removed the Lunéville peace of 9 February 1801: today's neighbors, who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying."</seg>
<seg id="19">The prototype for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded to all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, ie 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwriting numbered corridors from the so-called" "original recording" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots of land today no longer occupy farmers - but farmers of the plant" "Land in Sonne". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and not a concrete pit in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on the gas" "or from the height" "on the air" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based circle Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüften" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was advanced for his time and, for example, finished buying the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football pitch of the TSV Munich East lies west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in an architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in terms of bombing."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the" "Main Square", "the Kaufingerstraße was named" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the ground-breaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen's rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for the Promotion of Farcoloured has issued a warning for coloured people, who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for African-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to take special care when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here," stated in the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that are disproportionately aimed at minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped because of their skin colour, they will be beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report issued by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white ones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring deposits or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the country's 16th position."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws requiring local prosecuting authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU on further racial prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is spontaneous</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidemagn project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gave themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-place association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments holiday branches."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him," Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketable path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Exclusively regionales come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the chairman of Fischerbach's BLHV, he described the electric fence project as" elemental. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area provides a lot of work, much must be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers should be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their business," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">"because of the promotion, farmers often stand in criticism"</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the maintenance area is 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be listed until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs amounting to EUR 71 500 were supported by Leader, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White stood firm:" "best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape conservation line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area may not be tugable (inclination over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at present, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build just under 16 km of fence, is currently running for the Fisherbacher Hof Decoration Project 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is now taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate it as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have heard him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem that you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" on our screens was better seen.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about America's meaning.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a quite different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world:" "Lady Liberty is moving forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torches should not lighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotts belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The intermediate runner Muir goes on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1500 m, is another grotto that one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a big honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics via Facebook: do not work around a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating up of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long before the papers struck him for all, from domestic politics to political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shrank in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"because in 1783, Washington declared:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has established a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to deem his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum which is called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, reflective and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also appreciate this idea if a number of people take up the same issue, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective assignment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor staff referred to as a" concentrated spam attack, "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical supplies, or to arrest or silenced demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question happened last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters suggested to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain were overwhelmed by his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who led up links to the final round last year, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>

<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"this really feels special," "said the player based in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.</seg>
<seg id="217">To come back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, last year to win here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>

<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," "said Orr, the man from Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm glad how it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNine are with the trio on the field."</seg>

<seg id="232">"over the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking."</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>

<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was shot in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote for a public lifting in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which was stirring for independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, who maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>

<seg id="280">"in a report from the year 2016 Archdiocese Brisbane, reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims each week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>

<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to supplement historical human rights violations."</seg>

<seg id="335">"after I buried the corpses, the military searched for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not stopped.</seg>

<seg id="349">"some of the top-OPM guides come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">"agriculture is the task of women, who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato."</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the native land and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">"in spite of this, Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive."</seg>
<seg id="363">"young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobi, Chairman of the Paniai tribe. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, international media coverage remains tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Joko's campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unrest eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua, including the Paniai shootings."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian foreign ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai-shots," "says Gobi, the chairman of the tribal Council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants the Paniai people to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobi says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as" "guilt" "which he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, the victims of the Paniai-shot victims had a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they will never give them justice, but at least they don't forget those responsible for their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to share with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">"in doing so, he has so far underlined that a part of the customer has already withdrawn her non-binding reservation."</seg>
<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever trivial figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reported for the first time a different, less glittering number: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months Musk frequently had over 500,000 reservations for the new car, whose delivery just started."</seg>
<seg id="425">"Musk is now dreaming: 63.000 orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 reservations."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds)" reservation payment. ""</seg>

<seg id="432">"in 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="440">"one day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is a time limit which expired on 1 October for States, in order to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt announced that he would delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. ""</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly went over to block or delay regulations, which oppose chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prugs regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a review published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for carrying out," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and sponsors Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it's a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urcustomizbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the testimony of the certificate, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, which belonged to the church or the right of patronage and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamte Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be recognized today in the village image of Tumlings, the" mountain "of the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to the year 1600 prove this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right to patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"thus, the right to appoint a pastor or to suggest a new pastor to the Bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater the two shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded in 1692 for the first time, but was later released in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they broke out the pulpit and the church chairs, and used it as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm broke the bell tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius plant as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">"for the serenade of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the graveyard."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers have a fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade is only held in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant which is important for Tumble and Hörschweiler.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim defends itself" "sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the" "Boisheim" "association has invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the remaining urban area."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the town of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government was not approved by the district government in Düsseldorf, because of a lack of form."</seg>

<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheim Nette the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen was indirectly involved, signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district."</seg>

<seg id="608">But I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done.</seg>

<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with imprint."</seg>

<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgy oppressive moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks walks on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"until this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land, where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," "said a little boy, as if he wanted to remember."</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>

<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the council are hovering, such a common space not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniental home, but openly in the congregation."</seg>

<seg id="756">"the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget already in the past autumn will be made, by means of funding."</seg>

<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus, but I get a real counter-value in the case of doubt, that is the counter-speech."</seg>

<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be complemented by the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"for this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of the site."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the star path will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star path the viewer will learn much worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. "</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better right after the experiences in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how to act in aue," "says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause," "because we have just in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are still better harmonising and we don't do so many playing mistakes in building up."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can talk about an undecided start from a failed start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I first judge the start of the season only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who would not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely due to a thunderstorm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can practically start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorites in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know where they are at present," says the Fortuna winner. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"the guests from the Rhineland, as an easy favourite on Sunday, go to the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="884">"the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum process, they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, migration verket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older whereas in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constant over the past months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases suggesting that the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet sought out the 581 results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot say it, we should not do as if we could," "he said to the newspaper metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" generally, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is poor is low. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization monitoring the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make money easy, so that Neymar underwrites and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich family of Qatari."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be countered with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their business related to the football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after his election to the UEFA President in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, which had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked trying to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current 3-year FFP expansion period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to frighten off excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid out the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat-rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which later lowered to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassadors and easily find out such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG via Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with less members striving for an increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly annual inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalled that in the coming years, interest increases would be needed to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected from the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw part of Mammut's economic stimulus package issued one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"to the interest rates, it reiterated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat larger "scale than the markets would expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that enhancements would be" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>

<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages vis-à-vis the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rise in expectations on interest rates, and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will likely lie at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening is even worse before it gets improved."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy could not" prevent "incomes in the coming years," but she added that wages would be "clear" at the end of their three-year forecast. "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pound."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates had risen, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"Andrew Berlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are clamoring for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylactic prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should fund him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention" "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as" "decisive moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep has significantly reduced HIV transmission to infection agents.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants are identified in clinics including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as used in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted, targeted and vulnerable, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"said Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to bringing HIV in society closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted storage and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height perfect.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"fan had to think creatively, in order to solve the task."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Not only was it possible to build a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer room for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," Erfan explains to the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweighty, so that when you push the door very easily slides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional tie in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - accounts for about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property valued at $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul asserts, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick during the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, where Colin opened the first Jeanssouci family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass her property well to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group of companies, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were," Paul "has become bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very shy although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute," "he said and added that he" "still hope for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our business will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Feeding plans to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly actually can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information entered into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the employees that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television extends decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were too convincing," said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep trumps on Twitter is under control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these fighters know something that we don't know others - that trumps of tweets without their intervention would have included more ignition material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators managed to keep him away from him some times, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers, the President for strategic reasons, to provide doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former junk officials say that trump as a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone malicious to the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh" to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from twitter due to chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started questioning staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork of the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their failures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their cars through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Residents have pushed the council of Solihull to say that it is "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous resident said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath where they threw stones onto the passers-by.</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced by shame to put into action, since it was useless in dealing with the problem."</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof in the former ambience company company ltd. on 13th of April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues from the local tax were also lost."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels, managing director Birgit Scherer, with seat in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shell containers in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are undertaken."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything was to become" "beautiful" "later, as Thomas Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer points out."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Luise Waldhotel with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer does not want to set up precisely on the level of investment.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external installations are also transferred to the front wheel, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the committee recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there were already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men were to stand who acted as advisers to the Republican Party in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more trumps of private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderermittler Trump personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible crime incidents and decide whether an indictment is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand jurys are also called the Prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to be interrogated under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, charges have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, persons involved in the meeting had been summoned to a statement."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"beside Trump Jr. also Trump Jared Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort, also participated in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension shows that Mueller does not shy away in his work, and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to" feel good, "because they have nothing else about which they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, usually works in secret," "he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that he was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after she fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this crap, accusations against Trump have been louder, he wants to hamper the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"commenting on a Senate committee in June, Comey asked Michael Flynn to suspend investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later recalled president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislative designs on Thursday, after which the special promoter could not be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctic: giant iceberg moves in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has been loosened by the horseshoe."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which weighs over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakdown of ice caps in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"until now, the broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C Shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1528">Horseshoe floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some say that the Larsen-C Shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate stands under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-file would grow back or fall short in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, so many kingfishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"during the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees and counting down to the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers association to become more attractive."</seg>

<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be allocated this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">"together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU aims to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wish of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel development and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers, but also to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "competition of public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the ministry sick or age-related."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so, high time to act so that not even more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long been responsible for a rotten surprise already in the circle of chalk, when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and baffled the rest of the parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "people want all possibilities to be checked to make a withdrawal from the communal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the district administration should aim at the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a house tariff," "says peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU is trying to pay better for the employees and officials than the tariff for the public service actually envisages."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently dictated exactly, increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with human traffickers in a manner which facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio Italian prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," said the organization in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can assess all accusations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly from human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least such a meeting took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of overstepping on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons, and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any significant changes or obstructions to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine female bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The Shelter in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were more and more ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again there was a lookout point at the lookout point, connected by" flying "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters had been announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inscriptions gave welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers received healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 altimeters, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga roams for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in the future, the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles, rather than fighting through the stadium for wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gains inclusive."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"these have also recognised the first federal lignans, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning made 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "there are still some clubs on this train." ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup hosted the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, one could be seen online by far more often in these markets than to send the German ligaments to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sports, computer games like" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the FIFA World Cup will be contested at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"like in normal sports, songs have long since become established in which professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobber has been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console but also to exercise their body and take care of the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But fistrobbing also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform on online games and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrated effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "says the Deloitte consultant."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport race provider Unikrn.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football club associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an E-Sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in European comparison," says VfB CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer sufficient today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the society, but to align the company with the modern market at the same time."</seg>

<seg id="1661">"Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics, Conrad Roy"</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is not comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions brought Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance, which they deplore."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read an explanation of Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said there is" no day in which I don't have the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything. I try to be there for eternity, despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never be taking part in her brother's wedding or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer to have this single person, with whom I have been together since my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a coal-monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to finish his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang yourself up, jump from a building, get up yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote," You have to do it, Conrad "and" All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the fall by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimmich: learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">That Joshua Kimi was allowed to run as a captain for the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern will give a big season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something was different at his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimi saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made the bind on his arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner told afterwards, after his first mission as Bavarian captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the deposit would have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi was able to interpret the character of the coach as well.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the professional C-Elf's youth players, defamers and just from holidays."</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">So those who were chosen to accept the inheritance of Lahm can use a little extra motivation only well.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimi confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-lamm."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"on the right side, this is his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimi worked in this starting formation like the one, who can also take the helm in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the uncoordinated troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal started to overplay his missing fitness (collapsed hardly); Renato Sanches, trying to get out of the performance of the Asia-trip (collapsed also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not fall negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern tricot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimi, Rudy was running in front of the defense, both were sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the game setup."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admitted that the result wasn't as we had hoped for.</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a good performance during the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game shift, tempo change:" for this style I was also fetched. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as unaccustomed, the Bavarian world is still for the newcomers, one could see the game afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, did not have one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to his new players after a few crunchy statements.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard from Süle an interesting proposition:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria, you just have to win every game."</seg>
<seg id="1718">"after all, he doesn't have to teach the new."</seg>

<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU) says:" "knowledge attacks the desires of the economy, which has all blocked Lemke."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The largest downturn is natural in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the list of priorities.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 should be the right to construction."</seg>

<seg id="1733">"the goal is to put the track in operation in December 2020, says Ministeribert spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">"as von Wisser, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) strives to develop a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that have been sagging for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1743">"CDU faction, Christian Baldauf, refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than proposed in obtaining national roads."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Sobering is the previous broadband expansion in the country.</seg>

<seg id="1751">"one day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles."</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as callbacks.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"however, nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of automakers to install equipment for the neutralisation of exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of forfeiting the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but departing at normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former leader of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is declining due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted insects, which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, great headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicaine, a microbacterium, which transmits dwarf cicadas, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" "instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their divided topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney Office was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is still more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelve River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people will be shot at the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey Mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was the publication of a interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have angered the children, presumed gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters liked to be able to publish hard-hitting examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors-Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love to the routine of his calamity?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best, and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like to concern themselves with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways in order to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters surveyed whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs were de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for this week's edition, Riodoce has printed three major stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on state expenditures focused on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group, which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous occurrences in this restaurant, among them one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have watched Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we had already known what happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing" SOS Press "protests and buildings in organized protests."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked her to be re-classified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book entitled" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who were hiding under a ceiling with organized crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Wächtergroup" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists by the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was assassinated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky choices."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is scaring him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as at once all their telephones began to buzz."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting fights with belt rivets and security forces near the Mazatlan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curb edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren howls nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day, when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening figure."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even realize that his flaky skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the circle of circles between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preservedcondition has amazed researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast inside the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy Earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, although covered with armor, resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as countering, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed to mingle better with its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markedchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs were driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal to find evidence about his life, including his conserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the sea floor on his back."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as South-Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin but also retained in three dimensions and retained the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you look just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs were hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through the western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the marine conservation of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin-branches still cover bumpy armoured-plates along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the storm: mass arambolage at A8: many wounded</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometres long stands - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first data of the police were about 17.00 o'clock between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there are no indications of the exact number of injured parties."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A wide range of emergency vehicles was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometer long back was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as reported by an AZ journalist, it also came on the counter-road to massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade noted the hallmarks of the vehicle operators, who now have to reckon with sensitive punishments."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 hrs a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is clueless in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the conductor comes and wakes an unsuspected, or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow."</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and thereby devaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we will expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort check-in" "calls the track record devaluation without conductor."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have bought it through the app of the railway, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" "comfort check-in" "works like this: you go to the train, invoke your ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"in the case of the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train attendant is in place Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" "check-in" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel safely without ticket inspection by our train attendant, the DB navigator simply checks."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," "says Michael Peterson, marketing management board of DB Fernverkehr."</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second Plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel, know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"often you have, in any case, but one of the contributors does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of one's ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police tape and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, with which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and screamed:" "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 pm she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had" "countless times before this morning" "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I was lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgusting racism, she is no different than the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give it a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said, stating that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis presided by the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question is Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently said in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals, followed by the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shot."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "" said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love with and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement really is upheld by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who touched this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone missing but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory, since she walked into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a human "(Siggi Betzen) or simply" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build a gallery of more customers in the city, the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer's market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are very happy again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But that should not be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping list in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, footwear, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a good weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, as the local rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market hall go to during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, when the bit gallery actually comes at some point."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost-bit-gallery already manage to distribute all the shops in Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, doesn't need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg do not place any space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuffs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as a secret diplomatical news about WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline reconciled her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transformer and a pioneering dissident who was convicted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with this genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butors and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal glasses, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Supplement Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would convert Chelepa's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, commanded man's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there are also some deep and strong ones at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump carries out a war against informants from the governmental camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid circuits he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in a biological way, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, how she appears with a free spreader in hand from the United States discipline barracks such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they get cold, they have won," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacles, which clash like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement, which also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide hunt for men is in progress for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who have been looked for as suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several eras."</seg>
<seg id="2162">"a common warning system, published by the police authority of Chicago, states that the corpse was discovered on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">She has been an extraordinary professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been assessed and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirmed that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"" "we will close the WADA roadmap in the near future" "- Russian Vice-President Mutko"</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for re-fixing RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern to Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mutations agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal of WADA by conducting doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2203">Start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure your luck with your e-commerce start-up but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to offer surveys, specific groups and demographic groups, staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board of directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" "said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement."</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ailments and which managers have low requirements - so that you can drill down why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"close to 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"recently, uber has recently registered as a client."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like GLINT, Convercent companies can send tailor-made" "pulse" "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has recognised the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - identified and addressed faster."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies started to earnest ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical breaches by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot-tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour practice before they return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 AM.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real treadmill for the boys over the next three days," "said Bruins-trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday became Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it actually lengthens their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already packed timetables of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six playing times in Westwood practical exercises."</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are scheduled to perform 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players."</seg>

<seg id="2271">"and they simply pushed it through, they plump on, they're great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of upscale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a gate post, will not be easy task."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were even there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overvalued my welcome grudge") this seems to be all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and started to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards that represent what possessed:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all its gear!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising started in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be a foreigner, always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by getting married rich women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämalmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2322">"it was like:" "Oh, now I have to get ready again with the damned life."</seg>

<seg id="2324">"on Friday, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday) with the revelation of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Artz's logo and slogan secret."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"at the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on Grafenwerth Island."</seg>

<seg id="2329">"we think that (of course!) not really", "they write on their website released yesterday."</seg>
<seg id="2330">But we use this measure to gain your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">"basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"the promotion is about more than" "just" "a logo and a slogan, it means further."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is important to formulate an ever-standing promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling proposition."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"after all, it is in competition with other local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2336">The city of Bad Honnef pays off its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five-figure figure.</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensioners and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"under the presidency of the Heads of Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the consultations."</seg>
<seg id="2344">"as a result, the civilians in YAS were in excess."</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government forces the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"the Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the officers of the army, the air forces and the Navy were dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the failed coup, President Erdogan 169 fired the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the Movement of the Exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wire puller of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 persons, who allegedly participated directly in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the overthrow attempt as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really handle the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unease in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" Islamisation "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head for soldiers, wrote the paper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"at any rate, the major training in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan was fired by another 7395 state servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted on their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan was pushing back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an unnamed officer, who sought asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt, was going to be" full of extremists and Salafists "in a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, such a development could not let NATO get cold."</seg>
<seg id="2363">"in any case, there are doubts in the Alliance for the readiness of the Turkish army in the aftermath of the purges."</seg>
<seg id="2364">"the leadership structures and operational abilities are" weakened, "say NATO diplomats."</seg>

<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by spending the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries get green cards."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been fought over and over again - now it is supposed to go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">"before the end of the year, the ailing route, on which the tourist train runs, is to be built."</seg>
<seg id="2376">"in order to secure the future of the ski shuttle bus in the long term, construction work will start on the route according to the Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country admits to this particularly important link for tourism," said Minister Secretary-State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"from this sum, the country overtook 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2380">"the contract, based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country, will be finally agreed, declared Sühl."</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are traded," said Sühl. "</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"as a result, the Rennsteig shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">"over the past few months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it won't be even crazier in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "customize" "his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepper woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah "that conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step towards Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, unquiet one of the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement point to something more dense and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR noted their growing popularity, they nonetheless remain on the brink of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what crosses the border zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time when the rights of women around the world are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House, who has boasted to have sexual offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the elongated eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the words of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy minds</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a glump-era of the Trump era, that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate can also split families in small-format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to burst into our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of trumps, bringing families together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone she knows, including Republican kinship, with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it is noticeable in a further context that this also brings considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day we will no longer be able to repel his kittens."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the right wing" normalizes, "which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the Crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the NYC park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perming music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"they should improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6."</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from this.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">"no, the software updates that are negotiated are optional."</seg>

<seg id="2501">The Federal Office (KBA) has ordered its retrofitting.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but they do not yet have an exact date."</seg>

<seg id="2536">"the job is already written out, but suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker has been the mayor of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in keeping with the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as a lower construction law authority, the applicant has to present appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill this out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the hackers with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life worth," he is sure of the building office and his employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking area around are encountered.</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and stadium renovations are still subject to change."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will bring about 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is great room for a city engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, it is possible to respond flexibly to many things."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town stands under monument protection as an ensemble, it is important to have an eye for what fits" when new buildings are approved, the retiring city building master emphasises. "</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the city engineer is responsible for high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," at the end everything runs here over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing so for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and kept in place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"according to information from the town of Haslach, who would like to inherit Roland Wacker, should present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil and civil engineering, construction planning, undervaluation facilities, municipal property management, urban farm courtyard with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as lower construction law authority including monument protection."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern Railroad closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad tracks in the area of Leoben (B116) to the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a pink scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have brought themselves into great danger and also jeopardized the train traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport, donors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, a" substantial "sum goes out, the speaker said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the Südbahnhof (Südbahnhof) could be managed without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten passenger trains arrived on Friday afternoon, two of them covered the long distance."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall out, but they had a delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have also been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may result."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system is working with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a type of immune cell supporting tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was kept separately, did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial cells of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that a colorectal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers let L. Cross grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice and that most of us L. Cross in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2632">The surprise faction of a Green Party deputies overthrew the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is facing the CDU without its own government majority following the overstepping of the green deputies of Elke Trench."</seg>

<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning."</seg>

<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for its political survival."</seg>

<seg id="2653">"because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticisms for some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil always tried to accentuate accents in the Confederation in recent weeks."</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a fork lift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a questionable order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors, the Deputy Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours."</seg>

<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commanding officer. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "replied the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"Trump carried out an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft performed in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complain about the use of the presidential aeroplane by his predecessor."</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget names for the presidential ploughs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D however amounts to 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Unit recorded recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week, which are produced in America," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" Wir sind Kirche, "declared after publication of the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that" double standards "are measured when reporting violence in the domes."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it is" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "you like to go to the church and that's a connected fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that" "blows were a very normal pedagogical means" "in her youth," "to get ready with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the misuse cases, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote the reminder tape" My brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "for all that had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly stands in the 440-page report, which the lawyer employed by the diocese Regensburg presented with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen, sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility. ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence Exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible when a cathedral-set brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it all at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complication or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of non-violence at the preschool took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can at best reproach him, experience it too late or not have taken first notes seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatz gymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived as literally" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world" "by virtually all respondents."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also makes a very excellent witness," "sincere", "" "competent", "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional appeal, which also led to flood breaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knelt with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also drew ear files and drew too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are, of course, dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not more about his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope many, who have never understood him, are still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report also reported a great deal on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no. no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "said one affected representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of Sexual Abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen learners Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: "in terms of sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... boys have opened more urgent or clearer or even more open than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any involvement."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these reluctant crimes, as happened unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media a lot of" "violent excesses" "were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking away" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up in the coverage became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, it is neatly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also covers incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly channelled and maligned and suffered, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Domspatz gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, like most of the witnesses, the theme of" "primary school" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began establishing himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger strictly shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out," "that the test sentence continues to be practiced in the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative media releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing penalties were also banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit has been crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "so the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right here.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was done in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the past."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that's all awful, and I'm glad that it is finally worked up."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, that is, to drag ear-arrows and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he was strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter of testing also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in spite of this, I don't mean that he led a tight regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution until then, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets alone, one makes no big singers from unruly boys and stands before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work in the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep-believing and warm-hearted people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his vomiting, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely respect son, to whom they still look and worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that is presented to him are methods of education that were at the time of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to become a scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the lawyer would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps no one else could know Germany's Regensburger Domspatzen, at last in peace."</seg>
