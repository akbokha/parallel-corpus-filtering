28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery store .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as a murder and the investigation was underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , announced the ABS Tran@@ sm@@ itter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , held his dream job six months ago as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; to combine his style with his family was to cook us a bit , prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the stream .
&quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond , shining bright every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has the information about the case will be asked to call the exec@@ uting code of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in a drawer
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston will not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers , or I get stuck from the outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend their time at home , in front of television with local de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues searched for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and with that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
&quot; he left with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear at photo @-@ purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of hon@@ ors for the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ffen , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the J@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the price of lava ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
clin@@ ton and tr@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are un@@ affiliated with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep this in doubt rather small , and warns against how the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will make a massive decline in regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say . &quot;
interest@@ ingly both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; in the meantime , tr@@ ump and Clinton have to be inv@@ oked almost verb@@ ati@@ m . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
government investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; therefore , tr@@ ump could still come about in @-@ party discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations , and drive coal mining back to the US . &quot;
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump in this question wants to do is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says that he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house provides refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he glan@@ ced curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s assistant . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persecuted politically because they threaten to torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope for hope . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many secretly steal away because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the flight , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs require a sexual act for a bottle of water , is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , B@@ ahr tells . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this means that around 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ating them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily born . &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , called B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District Regi@@ ons are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction .
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the Govern@@ ments of Govern@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ dged women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , in some community shel@@ ters , there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says , &quot; It is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us to be there , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
agents of the assistance physicians have called upon their union to approve new labor disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour disputes from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; per@@ sever@@ ing quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labor action that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that this year , assistance physicians struck six times , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A resident , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I cannot forbi@@ d the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared to be narrow , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad . &quot;
his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the surplus of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was aw@@ ful .
Putin denoun@@ ced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ousin is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once upon a time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it responds to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me , as an analy@@ st once described it to me : two countries that feel sick and badly treated by the West and now unite . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both pres@@ idents express at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ ped the subject .
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
&quot; at the BBC Scotland , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from almost collap@@ sing and rescu@@ ing it eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
&quot; during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire . &quot;
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor @-@ brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we will now become more a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches â¬ 3@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; on his local race track , he set a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m very emotional , because my family is here too &quot;
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he brings victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys hit the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6000 wins , if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ra@@ ced for nearly 30 years in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori used to say that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 10 years of age .
Russian President Sergei Ivan@@ ov fired Chief of Staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the narrow@@ est confidence circle of Putin . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later served as chief of the staff and staff of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and to have V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has taken Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust the post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another close ally , Putin &apos;s ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he beat producer
&quot; last month , Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles . &quot;
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his cancellation on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on the set , there were artistic differences and differences of opinion . &quot;
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about the character of Gib@@ sons from the series , followed by a team of FBI agents , are expected to be released at a later date according to the statement of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been there since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series . &quot;
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that emerged in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that the 75 fish might deal with sandals that were sp@@ un off by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing the crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the â¬ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ k cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; deck@@ b@@ outs &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the â¬ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ k cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the whole bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete casting for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented building and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be still alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue Station hit 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty floating in safety , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; said the leader of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ at@@ engine had a stop@@ over , but this detached itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat cap@@ sized . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has watched over these men . &quot;
seriously injured - man catches up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he went to her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroying the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ erts his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old shr@@ u@@ gged his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who build Braunschweig low @-@ priced apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; investors should be taken to the obligation much more in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; concept for action &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president , Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be presented as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also be found in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U aims to make investors as few prescri@@ p@@ tions as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; regardless of that , so viol@@ ates , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of re@@ covering apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; for the end of the year , the end of the year is the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : the owners , the housing associations do not want to . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , one removes oneself from the goal of so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ ness . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can &apos;t be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , was pla@@ gu@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and recently on smartphones . &quot;
it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later , a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) were created . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon , which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to run it here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also stor@@ my players who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
it has made itself a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were already able to pursue our activity before , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be followed by time .
&quot; however , because of poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .

brilliant and brilliant .
&quot; and now , finally , Olympic Champion . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast en@@ cl@@ ed the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the art gymnas@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a combined battle title and the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on of her said she is &quot; &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after having won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , that is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school out@@ flow in the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained was became a force .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has won no more competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ a was led by two turns , the picture clou@@ ded . &quot;
beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ o holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her final funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on Bil@@ hah shining red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Mu@@ staf@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after the exercise of the floor , she threw out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the fast @-@ expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix as they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a weapon of fire , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; announced Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the ground . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ouses and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I did not create it . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , you have left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with a help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and bike rides .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund advoc@@ ated for &quot; &quot; Please sing something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected virus infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flood their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
&quot; Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities affected . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
&quot; in this area , the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain to drop in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday , while the Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the down@@ tro@@ dden rivers . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still hit people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another son &apos;s son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and pouring in , &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford said that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; rapidly spreading &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ all and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floor was significantly su@@ cked by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a con@@ fession@@ al in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa took 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches that were now both flooded .
&quot; the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and provided sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to take on , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded , but on Friday they have not been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was blown away by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores shared with the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot at the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several gun@@ men .
&quot; cartridge he@@ els for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were leg@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; reported police police Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police reports , according to reports , the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squ@@ ir@@ rel on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that is for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been doing so since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colors . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ n@@ ologists was an Af@@ ro @-@ American . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did not expect , but master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won Gold in an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this kind of sport , but this is not the case in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to put it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts in the first place in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the communities un@@ coun@@ table , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymnas@@ tics training . &quot;
I founded my foundation for 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team golden and thank you that so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors , who voted in favour of a vote , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract forci@@ bly and said the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to noc@@ tur@@ nal and weekly calendar to improve the maintenance of non @-@ invasive times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sts , announced last night in a statement : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have continued to deal with the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and meet all physicians . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through conversations provoked the government on reluct@@ ance , and sometimes on ear @-@ de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this was a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the attention and address the worries of the resident doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work action . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ ancy rate for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , urged Assi@@ sts to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do nothing but little , but already strain super@@ charged teams and service providers and prepare patients , foster homes and their families only cares , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance physicians and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , additional training sessions for those who returned from professional training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health related to the agreement with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the Â£ 2 per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 per day drug after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people suffering from heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory body has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year , and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British firm A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture leaves election fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ishing
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to ignore the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , which is now an opposition party , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a badge , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report suggests removing non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s electoral scandal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bias accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it .
up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric stated that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm about the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leading of ID cards to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said , &quot; &quot; proving that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi people . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit mail@@ boxes to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit to applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit complete let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police force the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations for electoral stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of taking pictures in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check checks &quot; of the election registration departments of the City Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; The court decision in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger and other famous double go@@ ers from Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only athlete , who is fighting gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; besides Kate &apos;s twin sister on the race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star disgu@@ c@@ ingly similar .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy announced the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I feel this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big , expressive eyes , is meant to be a double @-@ runner for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American has att@@ ested to Nathan Adrian of fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the American football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons were Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; like a pig . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian TV station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ater &quot; &quot; went off like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and died during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ mmer .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as Guy called , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai , Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
spectators throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Swi@@ mmer dies from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was quick and hard , with many people talking about him . &quot;
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , sorry it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the incident on Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; yet they were in@@ appropriate and an unhappy phrase . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled it out and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back on the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ dogs , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , getting back and going out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to be bot@@ her@@ ed by observing someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home , who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the garments from the sale after they went - which is exactly as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ dogs and find out that another woman touched her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her .
&quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a band in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when approaching from behind you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with the knee into the chest and twist , while the attack@@ er bows before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the gun and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
&quot; however , remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is most secure to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ trac@@ ted his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before empt@@ ying any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull @-@ in toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to flus@@ hing dum@@ pl@@ ings of toilets , the task posed its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test painting showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more ridi@@ culous than that !
&quot; I won &apos;t stop here , because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting in@@ doors . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D , in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; validation Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick it and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of gastro@@ intestinal and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ soci@@ etal family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ ge of Â£ 50,000 , because it terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls had lam@@ inated holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , garbage was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ iled her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; They sh@@ ook no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that it had been ab@@ using the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see would be able to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme , and their deeds for their neighbours had to be aw@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of Â£ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found himself guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial inspection .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after having been homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ ve tenants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after an eff@@ ected military jet beach flies over
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an incredible crash
&quot; the air forces announced that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was present &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ected jet crashes on a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the tourists jumped up when they began to worry about the noise of the nozzle ra@@ ids , without seeing what came through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro have been pan@@ i@@ cked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokesman said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to poor visibility , but the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people were killed on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which limits its view . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;

&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ meister has to give up with the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe league champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
&quot; in the training , the German suffered a b@@ ump @-@ up in the knee , with which the introduction of Bar@@ ca at least was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo for the time being . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique wai@@ ved a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applicants is the first step forward . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , Spanish champion doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
even at 3 : 2 at Pro@@ s@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
&quot; Sev@@ ille , in turn , di@@ gest@@ ed the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;

Ma Long in a separate league for table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Table Tennis Olympic Champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ winner first named the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title each other .
&quot; it was clear that , for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S N@@ Ã Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have coaches . &quot;
they pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ ests on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said to be logical . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma really had to fight only in the first set . &quot;
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang a total of 13 points . &quot;
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking b@@ ale changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had bred a rib@@ bed of rib@@ bed , after which he was in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and JÃ¶r@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , have been in the same high table tennis @-@ age Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump grants &quot; form@@ id@@ able problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the so @-@ called repub@@ lican strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp out of the race , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media cu@@ dd@@ les . &quot;
w@@ ack@@ le Repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ors from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equal . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the gap that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the march of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , be it in order , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to withdraw funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more responsive to Congress . &quot;
Olympics : three @-@ day fraud in dop@@ ing tests
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
athletes of Kenya are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; after a sc@@ aling test in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had informed that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , delivered and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing associations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia had to be targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA said Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this sport , it was possible to prove that , in this sport , it was severely dop@@ ed . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were therefore excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course na@@ Ã¯@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ pp@@ cans moved to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and today they are as informative as those days . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was alleged that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the bel@@ lied land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London embark@@ ed on a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the candidate &apos;s candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US Appe@@ als Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine distinguishes itself from classic school play@@ boys , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he thinks it does the Calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , the Kurdish community of Germany pays tens of thousands of protective seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the vice @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; following the coup attempt by the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in the medium term , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ lication before months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ aded put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees itself , in their own country , produces refugees , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association compla@@ ined of the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or driven over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critic . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a GÃ¼@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and Sa@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum entitled &quot; &quot; asylum seekers &quot; &quot; in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this amounted to 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all approved asylum claims ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are not those who fight against war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia cannot vote the Land@@ tag .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; the Sunday election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid than so far it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and country dances - that bites itself . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the campaig@@ ners are on vacation .
&quot; most of the holiday makers who are in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ Ã¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to vote the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate votes at the end , only pa@@ inst@@ ak@@ ingly apply . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass the election campaign close to the people over them . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
&quot; exciting will be how much new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaig@@ ning struggle , one can see from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ dy predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , she has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Angela has the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create &quot; has spe@@ eded up the ascen@@ sion of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events twice ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ ro@@ unding is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that on the land the base is crum@@ bling , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any left in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : thorns , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called out his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holidays @-@ need and move largely on the internet to their election campaign .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the president Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on track search for local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which will start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells about the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the opposite is also v@@ owed to those responsible for the construction of the building , for example when it comes to the establishment of comfort dri@@ ve@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straÃe in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant ail@@ ments , &quot; says the deputy head of the main office manager Florian King , responsible for the technical management of the rehabilitation project . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straÃe , Haf@@ ner@@ straÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege sought and rather trusted their na@@ vy than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community encouraged the measurement vehicle from M@@ Ã¶s@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute has been sp@@ las@@ hed .
the fastest was at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone with 77 hours of ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved forward , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s , everyone you ask is scrut@@ ini@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship of Mai@@ er , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the cat@@ ch@@ age is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road .
&quot; Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all restaurants were hit hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; he estimates sales revenue for &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the renovation of the street was &quot; &quot; thrown back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
&quot; instead , President JÃ¶rg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . &quot;
G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much has been handled more gener@@ ously .
&quot; in all cases , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated road traffic , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that his pedi@@ gree returns to the end of the renovation work , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months of construction work is brutal .
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly being scre@@ wed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the latest proposals , interior minister de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a state of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ look anyone .
&quot; other , further @-@ going points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was located in the results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re will have a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on air passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re will start a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and but@@ t jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U gives . &quot;
&quot; he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which has no chances in the co@@ ali@@ tional partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick @-@ action for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are pur@@ pos@@ efully caught in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the event of Dul@@ ce for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than up to now - such as commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legally binding .
some of them still have an effect on them and leaves them open to questions .
and at some point - in the im@@ balance treatment of tolerated - for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be denied that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures . &quot;
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly occupied did not let themselves be clas@@ sed at election events .
the inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
&quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are campaigns . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past days , the two parties went up high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the res@@ ent@@ atives also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re also lab@@ ori@@ ously works here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he holds nothing of a return from the double pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he raised constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it is still necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is also trying to benefit from the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still very sli@@ pper@@ y .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running around .
&quot; in the recall action , there is whi@@ r@@ l around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts sub@@ du@@ ed in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the overall sales , as the company noted down in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; sales of sales by JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days , less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the exit from the EU also stressed a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas chamber initially escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
a big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further ag@@ grav@@ ated by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 per cent is attributable to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler continued to demonstrate sales growth . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to fit into the workshop . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over , the car maker has a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for newly equipped diesel models .
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
VW has fully fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and KBA .
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not take place after the conversion , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not , as it was said in corporate circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example six months after conversion - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal , there is no uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future criminal interest rates - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , Bank chief Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding â¬ 100,000 in sight deposit accounts or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he jumped 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now further increased . &quot;
&quot; leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the banking officer . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ s- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Federation of Banking , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay widespread fees for deposits , but the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is luxuri@@ antly equipped by fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; , &quot; if they are free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calcul@@ ates a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , declared : &quot; the threshold of going to the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition was tough , and it threatened to emig@@ rate from investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not like that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to comment section in order to over@@ see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ all@@ men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but also to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ net by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record purch@@ as@@ ers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ d@@ ging before I stop , hold my hands and say something weird like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o slowly cle@@ ars its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men middle aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and were forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received an impetus from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound@@ boards , from items that watch happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
I think it &apos;s like a collector and I think it &apos;s like that for many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a stack of records . &quot;
&quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ other through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ class . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates , has a colorful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ology and sex@@ clu@@ ded pop rather than experimental jazz sounds from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but psychological trauma is difficult to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
it makes a window bum@@ per rather than a big shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I look at the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates by Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security , not stro@@ lling through Turn@@ h@@ ops of Ber@@ wick Street and She@@ ets through records , while they avoid the star@@ ving gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who dominates the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court has refused an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be allowed to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and which offer a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafÃ©s and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants , on Friday , estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin stays competitive
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance during the Olympic time , cycl@@ ist Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be under@@ scored . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in sight , stay confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; honestly , I find it hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; Martin commented . &quot;
he had to analyse in peace which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should lead to a particularly effective temperature . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic enforcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident sever@@ ity points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary tem@@ per , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary aper@@ ture to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measurement operations ; the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through prohi@@ bitions at the time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art movement , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent it from cl@@ apping , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sh@@ red@@ ded outer hull van@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technique : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain picks up silver in 7 @-@ bit ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold picks up
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ hour Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening with the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a comfort for UK - but will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England out of Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
&quot; eight years ago , under R@@ yan , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks of G@@ Bs boun@@ ce off from fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au over@@ came in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a sle@@ e@@ pless T@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new one since the beginning of the game and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through other weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still cores . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ li@@ ans whose fans sang , flags flew and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame placed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more precious gold than in these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was present when she ruined the second Olympic old in the two @-@ man without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , which set such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written bet , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers , who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and no one was more hel@@ pless than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances the right term is . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a busy morning talking a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the water utility &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water pur@@ veyor as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution by the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ Group was &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , who was a member of the company for 31 years , was 28 years old as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 towns and villages with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for other cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller worked as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , ranging from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations , because water and drinking water are the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised GÃ¶@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association regularly as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller commen@@ ced Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ cher and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult action were , however , the rup@@ ture in the high can@@ ister near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on the 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼r@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will follow Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller &apos;s successor . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko walks openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has progres@@ sed well and is now studying privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded them mort@@ ally .
&quot; the man himself called us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly punished . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a couple of years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be directly addressed .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in LÃ¼@@ beck initially did not want to make any information about the proceedings or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying anymore , &quot; said a police spokesperson in LÃ¼@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - light of light for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from the green power promotion are from the table .
&quot; in the case of exemp@@ tion from the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for the so @-@ called &apos; own @-@ current production &apos; in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economics said Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; according to this , the European Commission initially planned that the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption would ask for cash @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is possible . &quot;
but this is also not the case in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; in view of our &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions law trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed down , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw masses of steel onto the world market in the light of weak domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation is somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on imported steel have an effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ant . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at last , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the German economic association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt School she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; who regularly calls his lungs , is not so quickly out of the pu@@ ddle in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senior Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , shared singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people fall ill with dementia in long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands a special performance , declares L@@ enz . &quot;
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I do a long time for something , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the circle of acquaint@@ ances sings in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
you can also find many sen@@ iors on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ ver on the cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the fen of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also left the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to lau@@ ts of kit@@ ten , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of kit@@ ten - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ oral cries were different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ te of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from the mother and the si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful ones .
&quot; all the females , even those who still had no offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned to the loud@@ speakers more quickly when this calls were played by the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist said Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kÃ¼@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kÃ¼@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ic@@ ta Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even in the case of the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is not possible to stop football . &quot;
&quot; against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kÃ¼@@ r , the At@@ tor@@ ney General issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South Bank living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; SÃ¼@@ kÃ¼@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; it is true that the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of the majority of Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy watch &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan an end on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Workers &quot; Club of Bes@@ ic@@ ta do not traditionally count among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , however , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will again arrive . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say goodbye to the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ ta the game year ran better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as SÃ¼@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King laid the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans look forward to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; after the coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had only been announced at the AC Florence after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after its European holidays . &quot;
&quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , however , the storm would have to be prepared to renoun@@ ce around a third of its annual salary estimated to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova should not start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fe@@ m@@ owa , who compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing barrier shortly before the games , was whi@@ pl@@ essly whi@@ stling and ki@@ cked off at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; there was a bizarre scene : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a rush storm . &quot;
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past during the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ ech@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after it was proven to capture the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had a strong tooth ache , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion , was positively tested by the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ doctr@@ ination and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means for penis enlargement had been responsible , entered into Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer throw , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized after so many med@@ als . &quot;
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
&quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title for testosterone mis@@ use . &quot;
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized as a medal for the 2008 Olympic Games , was awarded by CA@@ S International Sports Court . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hur@@ ts - Multiple people dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cutting wounds and was treated in the hospital , but I had already left it . &quot;
her return home was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he are also Austrian citizens , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , said Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a life district of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explosive charges went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach , Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower be@@ et in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ eastern coast also called for several injuries . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days ahead of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives , but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks , typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group will put behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is self @-@ sufficient to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the freedom of freedom of democracy , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are becoming more and more diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ del@@ usion , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ aries &quot; are already observing . &quot;
Ma@@ sturb@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the national offices .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own business .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly susceptible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ine said , he did not have any knowledge about that . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party , in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; in view of the significant increase in rights @-@ related crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups are formed to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who had not previously appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly exagger@@ ated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia swa@@ m so slowly that at times it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media called it &quot; Ro@@ ble of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny about it . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot;
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool in Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to ride alone over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympic only eight months ago and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been scre@@ ened .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their shop on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back the next morning at 8 : 15 a.m. , the cash desk had disappeared from the cash desk . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so narrow
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , but it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end it will either fold or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
mail climbs into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; in the near future , the Group intends to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post office will also be offering its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post spokesperson on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been testing whether they will sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post office JÃ¼rgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always questioning , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group intends to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and long @-@ term changes to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ lights came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Executive Director Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the tip of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management stands the world &apos;s number five in front of a personnel new start .
G@@ FR@@ P Executive Director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the previous Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; the company called &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation as a reason for the return cuts . &quot;
details did not want to call a spokesman on Friday .
it is still unclear who will run the market research company in future .
&quot; in the group of investors it was on Friday , with the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago . &quot;
Mr Hart@@ mann joined the Gf@@ K team since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts like that . &quot; &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss trip in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at â¬ 36@@ 1.2 million , sales stood at 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent to EUR 72@@ 1.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were primarily bur@@ dened by the sun@@ ken value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Ã¶n@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hear@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the deta@@ inees suffered serious injuries , reported the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her statements , had to avoid an opposite vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident spot on the Landes@@ straÃe 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns district P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3.@@ 44 euros for the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl . 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvements are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sleep@@ y calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the Office of Agriculture Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that for these sewage plants under@@ cover was running . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 citizens and trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous period of calculation should be offset . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste of wastewater , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , wastewater volumes in all three plants are slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; in addition , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair , all three plants continued to grow in a significant extent in the previous calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ hin , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the az@@ endorf sewage plant .
&quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge removed and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; in addition to these extraordinary expenses , the ongoing care and maintenance costs associated with the new calculation period have been taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were full .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for these plants will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage utility association can not be extended because it is a lack of public facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when Posi@@ tive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect has been critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies each day . &quot;
all false appearances come to the public .
in the past Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and ha@@ zy che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow spotted . &quot; &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was designed as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter remembered breaking c@@ lich@@ Ã©s . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos was that the filter &quot; hur@@ t@@ ingly and gel@@ inde &quot; was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older counter@@ parts - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it &apos;s much harder that such things go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence service information , notes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , a committee of inquiry made in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican Members of the Repub@@ lican Members of the Ar@@ med Forces Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s intelligence agencies , reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence related information , typically found by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com belong to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed reporting problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com representative publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are under way through the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; compensated morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats announced not to have found any clu@@ es on a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political view . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have retro@@ active effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim , which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the intermedi@@ ates of more than ten years ago than a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after stating the government posts that contrary to the statements of the government &apos;s air@@ strikes against the oil refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative authority because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever to have done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; they know , however , that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which , after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan , remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman , who will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always , the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss about their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , started turning things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the workplace in London that we now have .
we have been able to break the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand blow from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team appeared surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and l@@ apped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are permanent and ines@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed down from the cross@@ bow to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athlete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock of dimples , could have definitely been among those familiar names that are sent to Prime Time , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign long .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
that could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had won an athlete until 2012 , who managed it up to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share the women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit , that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never ending boun@@ cing - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and do@@ ves , the two sports which it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are rated according to execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts need to go farther , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes down and down , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further heights in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ directed pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I personally feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the tra@@ mp &apos;s v@@ ector is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games only can be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ape and the obj@@ ecting of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ ating , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters during the clas@@ hes with the police were killed in shooting .
is Ethiopia to collapse just in the process ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more territories . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , head of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continued to supp@@ ress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you want to supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den who were forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness gradually explo@@ de under the surface after years of bitter@@ ness .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media , because cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government obstruc@@ ts access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were so prot@@ esters .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as , who predominantly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but that also changes .
&quot; we are coordin@@ ating under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who are about 6 percent of the population , who are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , has until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ an@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ an@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al was 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting that , according to the statements of analysts , apparently fed by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government &apos;s internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights via the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has created IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lican candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his comrades , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the reference to an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the claim on Thursday returned and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; Of course I mean sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more bi@@ ased note , as its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ el Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them am@@ bass@@ adors , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by subj@@ ecting it to aggressive the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of rus@@ hing around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , CafÃ© is coming back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; verb Cafe was a big@@ oted cafÃ© in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displaced . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people ro@@ cked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and verb is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old cafÃ© , the owner and managing director of the new cafÃ© . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered him a customer to provide funds for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes like cap@@ ers and sau@@ erk@@ raut onions . &quot;
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the cafÃ© serves no beer any more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also replaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she went to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they are preparing my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for use with the coffee @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;ll go to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the cafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to leave them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafÃ© closed .
&quot; when the new cafÃ© opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ bes felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s ter@@ rap@@ in soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; the last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the United States , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ l@@ ly snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ney , this couple found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; Co@@ e asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le re@@ vit@@ ate as &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
odd mixtures have been tried out as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has given preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during her research for the book which includes recipes , brick prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - looked at the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and to transform P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ eating attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man of the world he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the fall of the wind .
&quot; after finishing the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e dra@@ gged out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , and added that it was a common plo@@ y to give a modest name to recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
each di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly it wasn &apos;t bad .
Co@@ E got a hit three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; Some hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civilian control group who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant showing him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as heroes , said according to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea on board the research ship S@@ anna . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sh@@ arks are getting offspring only with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the ground of the North Atlantic , in one hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a depth of 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , which is characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a recipe for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist had long suspected that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks will be st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; their time @-@ slow pace was when they equipped six animals with a transmitter , in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may chase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which are tor@@ turing from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
&quot; their birth should , therefore , lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ res of the third smallest animal , the l@@ enti@@ cular core contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ ker @-@ core , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the Rekord @-@ Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res would be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to al@@ locate the length of an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ als live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot;
&quot; so , they mature later - and age more slowly . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; thus , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains Sch@@ euer@@ lein , an evolutionary bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
building grounds in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focused on issues relating to building construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ eration and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street path &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of SchÃ¶@@ nau will appeal to young families and senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ ler can now report to the town hall from now on , and the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session about the allocation of the plots . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year , in order to be able to meet other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the industrial area that has already been designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main therefore has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is sufficient . &quot;
that &apos;s why big US banks are using this .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk cor@@ relates ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , it also cuts off as much as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
it also points to the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rent for premium commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the River Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , econom@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; in London , in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in London , and in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead to receive legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American in@@ verter decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to a reduction in costs arising during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took possession of each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops backed by the United States say that they have again rec@@ ap@@ tured full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; backed by the United States , troops have taken full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left them , a spokesman for the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried itself within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently investigating the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 , and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million to char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ ors ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; in collaboration with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ pers J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ treats with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argued , as a reason for his refusal , a tax audit by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the release of the Democrats candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspections were not concluded . &quot;
&quot; dr@@ umps critics , among other things the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business interests and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump asking for his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke on the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , tr@@ ump to a meeting to discuss their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , have an average tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 tax declaration showed that these USD 100 of their income obtained as a reward , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton Divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der ; fire@@ works body promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ y .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its funding together with U.S. conservation efforts by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , making them much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition barrier . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spreads fine dust to the air . &quot;
a breath is usually sufficient to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last chance is a ver@@ fer , who shoots a gold mine in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; however , the Municipal Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a new factory at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s currently under construction . &quot;

Jewish director breaks down Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed Israeli pres@@ election , since Arab guests had claimed &quot; a staff . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel in the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how did it happen in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via their own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; sho@@ wered him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind this was even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were dis@@ cour@@ aged and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the Internet , where people called it a scandal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another article stating that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police relies on tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to dis@@ integrate the students , leading to the fact that the police replaced rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tim@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison with Iran and Teher@@ an . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador announced . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ i@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation gave approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached top 20 countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : drow@@ ning beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶l
a rob@@ ber@@ y case has been practiced on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe .
&quot; in front of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces demanded the issu@@ ance of cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators have to be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel car park situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 PM ) are urgently required to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer holidays
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near MÃ¼h@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first week of school holidays , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of the school . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it was about saving with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers were treated with their own food dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ Ã¤tz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ Ã¤n@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ Ã¼b@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Portal of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ este@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were tackl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ y trip of all ministers in two years , the Upper Minist@@ erial Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were tested , and it was finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 And they came out of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and all the rooms of the rooms . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ey sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman standing and so the pilgrimage route from MÃ¼nster was started . &quot;
&quot; each day morning and evening , each day was accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a stop to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrims song . &quot;
parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast at the stage destinations .
continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on this stage , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at the time of the heat , some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed . &quot;
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pool in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster later in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the evening mass in MÃ¼nster , the Min@@ is welcomed by operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metrop@@ olitan metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite gold rings for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the V@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself to E@@ igen . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick , after being in March at the World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ di , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner set up an Olympic med@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ di fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear in order to slow down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the final round , we have set up an Olympic med@@ ord and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ di said , &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle . &quot;
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
&quot; that would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y now takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won Gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with appo@@ in@@ tees before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas took place in the background , the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ bling proj@@ ec@@ tiles , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of workers &apos; jobs , stand at stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is going to exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect , could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could result in dom@@ ino effects as the melt consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force as of November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point on , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual ab@@ yss of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 , it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation as to why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 900 MW of electricity per year to consume around 900 MW of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as generating sets it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to weeping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , sc@@ anned reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the all@@ y- popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ Ã© plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant brought the sentence &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow on this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to have sm@@ itten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling an image volume rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut fashi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expected so long@@ ingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still going through before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover are Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mod@@ ells &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover for a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even though everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Eye &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these feelings showed up again when the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying on the de@@ mis@@ e seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; city centers show 160@@ ,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid supplies are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the sector is looking forward to the effects of further medium @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; the municipality &apos;s legal services , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal funds . &quot;
the director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell &apos;s municipal coun@@ ties said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es found that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s congreg@@ ational centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the means by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney and Federal Justice Minister as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign indic@@ ted after collabor@@ ators allegedly pulled arms
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , after it was announced that their campaign manager for North Carolina sent a gun for a staff in February , while in February they were on the road in je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i began to have waited for months for the matter to be resolved internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a gun and put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the race in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; he said in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
the accus@@ ation only lasted two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge .
&quot; the campaign made clear that the media tore his words out of context , and that he would not commit to violence . &quot;
&quot; the complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care , and Philip because of bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks won &apos;t reach Tr@@ ump Press Spo@@ kes@@ person for a statement . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip were also missing .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; not responding to calls from consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot;
&quot; so far , Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are recorded .
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black governing coalition in the north could go@@ vern almost further in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago . &quot;
&quot; the party , according to the poll@@ s , was just close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to enter the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the survey said that only 23 per cent of the survey was voted in Berlin ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were still behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss the move in comparison to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover , Germany . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reachable . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , albeit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found .
&quot; very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile phone sector experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; around 1.4 billion devices sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple began its triumph@@ ant march , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
she finally van@@ ished to fight Black@@ Ber@@ ry .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; today , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we are already offering 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ used on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , Â£ 2@@ 11 bn for fun growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a Â£ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will be one too .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; C@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; for ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ads blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post where it shared that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertising display to make it difficult to identify indicating which part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &apos;s spokesman wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of h@@ in and forth fight between the an@@ ad @-@ cur@@ sing open source community and the envel@@ opes has already been in progress since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying ads have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the ad revenues . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokesman shared . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook receives the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; advertising preference tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters because they would block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over the people &apos;s hands . &quot;
woman in case of suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d .
&quot; a woman laid herself in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , which promp@@ ts them as well as any witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers cannot be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , having gone over a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have re@@ fut@@ ed earth @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ative atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned further . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus expos@@ ures its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution , which had previously been suspected by planetary researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed -- in the course of several billions years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy was awarded the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers again call for talks , strike out strikes &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles concerning the remuneration for the North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties of the dispute sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ tops in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; as a result of lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation which has increased by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea will be expected compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;

the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler World Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star @-@ run rotate to different rates and in which context the rotation periods are associated with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star @-@ stars , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
&quot; to peak @-@ rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than fewer solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers with bigger stars turning slower than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so near , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars can slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which are soon to be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Director of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid back Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he has made several mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the rest hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect to have received powerful means for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league might have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back at the time . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with pop star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson were told , sympath@@ ies of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch Boston red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a bad athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed the expul@@ sion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have taken over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
chen has applied for the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association took the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news flew over the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is the dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already have been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly expressed his criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known ; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both must not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had banned the entire Russian team up to one exception for systematic dop@@ ing , including Kenya &apos;s L@@ Ã¤u@@ fer@@ nation in Rio many bad news . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the swimming sport , the past occur@@ ren@@ ces in China were also provided for serious confron@@ tations among athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass it , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 with the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ brÃ¼@@ ck hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently attacking businesses - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators special@@ ise in attacks on company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially too black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send ads . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was frigh@@ tening quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to break the business operation completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of acute attacks . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers examined the areas of use and contact with the black@@ mail presses and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to get more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private persons are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must deal in part hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to recover their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , &quot; explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus service Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; it is more prob@@ able , however , that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the malware kits have been created by buying malware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ berries are then looking for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is well @-@ known among many companies that better safeguard their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of a file back @-@ up and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetr@@ ators threaten instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chairman Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ Ã© and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty much over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off somewhat . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on high @-@ raised and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie bo@@ ilers and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling .
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , turn his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; in the top version of the &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment is not desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; during manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles if necessary the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and a HDMI connector lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with its HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court DÃ¼sseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only possible in case of dangers that are typical of aviation , the Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; after their journey , sick leave only money when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a trial , a family on the second day of its course of tur@@ mo@@ il had severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant which allegedly polluted sea water .
the family thought that the trip was insufficient - and was indic@@ ted against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
&quot; in fact , the sewage treatment plant was defective . &quot;
but the organisers only knew about it before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the sentence . &quot;
especially since no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the overall risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in WÃ¼rzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks in July . &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and determined to react at the same time to terrorism .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and split .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , however , the security and strength also increased the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the Federal Parliament elections in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit size over several years . &quot;
&quot; again , sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨res &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re plans to use concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhance security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed action . &quot;
&quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship .
a general ban on full @-@ wear is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talking about rules about road traffic or witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the Minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages of action and action .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ver@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ akes regularly on the stra@@ pping street - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening , when driving through the motorway &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger &quot; &quot; ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er StraÃe , the road construction will extend the legal de@@ fle@@ ction lane by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then thread directly from the hammer StraÃe to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic is increasing early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straÃe 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &quot; &quot; Con@@ federation of MÃ¼nster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back @-@ jam goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er StraÃe .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back three @-@ quarters ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity , in order to take the heavy load traffic in two lanes . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ based traffic jam will last , the responsible state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : because the bridge has an official remaining useful life up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal remedy , the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is expected to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
traffic is run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s society enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theater in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the NGO N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; between September 2015 and March 2016 , most youths in the class have come to Mu@@ en@@ ster from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy theatre MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical distribution are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
&quot; the weather has taken a line through the bill in the southwest of Germany , in the southwest of Germany , in the night - but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing Night : tips for Sle@@ eping Dis@@ orders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the mor@@ nings there is no longer to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ eping , member of the board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is an inhal@@ ing and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; many people simply feel inadequate or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind it , but also medicines . &quot;
not in@@ frequently sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often common in case of depression , &quot; says Weber . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are damp@@ ening one another .
&quot; for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can sleep poorly , wake up every two to three hours , and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , gives them an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you sleep with a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are com@@ promised on the day , go to the doctor , tell we@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look very different : you are beaten , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out about the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ itÃ© UniversitÃ¤ts@@ medizin Berlin , is not present in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , if you have problems with sleeping problems , you should first contact the family doctor , advise them . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what will happen ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing agents , in case of poor daily fatigue , in case of sleep @-@ trans@@ duc@@ ers or if the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance is not found , Fi@@ etz explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; after sli@@ mming , you go to bed at your normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of jack@@ bolts on which you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts : regular bed@@ time and up@@ li@@ ft@@ edness , not to sleep long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a &apos;s short @-@ road world championships and at the same time he set up his first world record . &quot;
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now put himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates standing in front of his criticism .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic Champion received 20,000 â¬ bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 â¬ , no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the support system in swimming sport is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
this means that we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see the topic of dop@@ ing so closely or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you can &apos;t control a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part . &quot;
airport : gang of bags arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the DÃ¼sseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers of the DÃ¼sseldorf Police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a band , the susp@@ ects had committed several bag and luggage pil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants at the DÃ¼sseldorf airport recognised a gang which was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year , working together in a collaborative , labour @-@ friendly manner and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department , 34 , can prove four actions to the thi@@ eves who had traveled to Germany in order to commit crimes . &quot;
&quot; in total , they captured a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; having been evacu@@ ated on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents are walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others talk about late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who plays three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted more police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors make up , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today also has a low average income and high poverty rates compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a real road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by j@@ ars or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with paint bags .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year , together with the words &quot; &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ enses , such as body injury , are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes are causing damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house in a rented house for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously moved to the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; this is why it was so important for her to get her streets back : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps that drive the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; that is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well cared for here are living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot approve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should we do if someone has never listened to ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene were part of the neighborhood .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub district , can complain about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the egg @-@ reli@@ ant Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , who has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than on the large number of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; wanted was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an urgent Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central part , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has fixed a 50 per cent period for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in Was@@ en@@ straÃe
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and the Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; until now , it is not possible to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communal dwell@@ ings need to be ch@@ aired , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straÃe .
but only with apartments is it not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; apart from a solid lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , scho@@ oly@@ ards , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here too , administration and community of volunteers jump . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it will take a long time to bridge their time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases also , &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the latest events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine Kunde says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers have already been sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations make them completely ob@@ itu@@ ated .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they have always been in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is aw@@ k@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already at full capacity to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters wanted
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
police had several squ@@ ad@@ resses as well as a police helicopter .
the for@@ ebo@@ ding proc@@ eeded without success .
