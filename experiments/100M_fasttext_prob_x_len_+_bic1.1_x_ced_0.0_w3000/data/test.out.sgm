<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues searched for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear at photo-purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honors for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master's winner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giffen, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Reuderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Jdoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the price of lava ran."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential candidates are unaffiliated with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small, and warns against how the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he will make a massive decline in regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the meantime, trump and Clinton have to be invoked almost verbatim."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, trump could still come about in-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more apparent.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations, and drive coal mining back to the US."</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want we to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump in this question wants to do is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says that he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands trump, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He glanced curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Director of Condrobs, a sponsor for social aid offers in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's assistant."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are persecuted politically because they threaten to torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope for hope." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there are other reasons for the escape:" many secretly steal away because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the flight, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs require a sexual act for a bottle of water, is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, Bahr tells."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that around 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, appreciating them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not voluntarily born."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations only for them, called Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District Regions are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the Governments of Governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, fledged women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, in some community shelters, there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says," It is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be separated and accessible to women easily, in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need of protection, one can read the rush that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us to be there, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Agents of the assistance physicians have called upon their union to approve new labor disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour disputes from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers had agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persevering quiet "to problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solicit official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labor action that begins at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that this year, assistance physicians struck six times, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the leader of the BMA resident, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I cannot forbid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared to be narrow, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the surplus of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was awful.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousin is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once upon a time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it responds to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent resentment on the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" Ã©tat. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glittering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an" alliance of outsiders "to me, as an analyst once described it to me: two countries that feel sick and badly treated by the West and now unite."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both presidents express at the press conference that they hadn't even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he later served as chief of the staff and staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and to have Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust the post for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the KGB National Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had violated Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close ally, Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The â¬1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the North-deck of the Queensk crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closure of the" "deckbouts", "which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The â¬1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensk crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fitting."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the whole bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete casting for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented building and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "the SPD and the Greens said:" "investors should be taken to the obligation much more in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "concept for action" "at the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D vice-president, Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be presented as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also be found in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, however," Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as 20 percent of housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU aims to make investors as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of that, so violates, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the budgetary spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of recovering apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for the end of the year, the end of the year is the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: the owners, the housing associations do not want to."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one removes oneself from the goal of so-called thoroughness."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">"PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off"</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, was plagued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs) were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days PokÃ©mon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for PokÃ©mon, which are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "average" "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that followed 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays PokÃ©mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to run it here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about PokÃ©mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also stormy players who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made itself a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were already able to pursue our activity before, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be followed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, because of poker's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson of her said she is" "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, that is not really true."</seg>

<seg id="26">"even if Mustafa was led by two turns, the picture clouded."</seg>
<seg id="27">Beams and floor plans - in which Bilo holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,933 on the floor. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her final funeral - a pure formality - and tears poured out on Bilhah shining red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake on Mustafina went."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called" "Grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after the exercise of the floor, she threw out kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the Turns and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been doing so since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnologists was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did not expect, but masterful gynectic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won Gold in an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this kind of sport, but this is not the case in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts in the first place in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the communities uncountable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golden and thank you that so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors, who voted in favour of a vote, rejected him."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract, which includes changes to nocturnal and weekly calendar to improve the maintenance of non-invasive times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assists, announced last night in a statement:" "assistance physicians have continued to deal with the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and meet all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture leaves election fraud in Muslim areas flourishing</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"former cabinet member Sir Eric Picles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Local Government, which is now an opposition party, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a badge, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter has to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests removing non-removable ink on a person's finger if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to congregational documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutsk Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "cynical" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobias accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric stated that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm about the fraudulent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leading of ID cards to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said," "proving that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi people."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity in terms of ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists edit mailboxes to stop" election harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit to applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit complete letterings and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up shut-off stations for electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law facilitated an indictment for intimidation according to the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of taking pictures in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check checks" of the election registration departments of the City Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," "The court decision in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the buyers didn't know where to look, when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a primarrow to try underpants."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in order to worsen the situation, she looked as she looked at it, pulled it out and put her back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">"she continued and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, Germany."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark store at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back on the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear, she came back and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when they pulled out the underpants, which you obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three other underdogs, before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, getting back and going out."</seg>
<seg id="12">She didn't seem to be bothered by observing someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the underpants that she had tried.</seg>
<seg id="13">"MS Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said:" "how disgusting to think that someone would take underpants with home, who had another person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mrs. Davidson added:" "as I have received, the employees have tried to draw the garments from the sale after they went - which is exactly as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underdogs and find out that another woman touched her and went out and didn't wash her.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman for Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products coming into question were drawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga band in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers near distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when approaching from behind you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot, "Mizrachi says."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with the knee into the chest and twist, while the attacker bows before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the aggressor cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, remember that in a robbery it is most secure to hand over your money - if you are not a Krav Maga Grand Master."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subtracted his immune system and litters of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before emptying any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lick the rinsing button of a pull-in toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to flushing dumplings of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitively under a sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test painting showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands are of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more ridiculous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I won't stop here, because it's disgusting indoors."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D, in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick it and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of gastrointestinal and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asozial family left their social housing after a deloge of Â£50,000, because it terrorized their neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treviscock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had laminated holes, wooden floorboards were torn up, garbage was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strides and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloiled her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one of them said," "They shook no one."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing said that it had been abusing the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the lessee would be able to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as a delogivation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme, and their deeds for their neighbours had to be awful."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloge on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of Â£1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial inspection.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will delve tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police informed that the Delogiance was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a scaling test in a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary had informed that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenias of doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has requested the IOC to obtain information about the case in order to exert its own investigations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said it in an IAAF declaration. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent Ferguson Rotich, delivered and signed the rehearsal," explained Kenias Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before the Kenyan Athletics Heads of Heads Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about upcoming doping tests against cash payments from his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">"according to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Kenya, the IOC has been under special observation after numerous doping associations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia had to be targeted."</seg>
<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, WADA said Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control conforms with the rules of WADA."</seg>

<seg id="25">"in this sport, it was possible to prove that, in this sport, it was severely doped."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was alleged that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the bellied land and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other maids from the east of London embarked on a plane in the direction of Turkey, followed by a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the GÃ¼len-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"at short notice, the Kurdish community of Germany pays tens of thousands of protective seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it might even be" a few hundred thousand, "believes the vice-president Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"following the coup attempt by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in the medium term, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had outstripped Kurdish strongholds with implication before months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the shaded putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees itself, in their own country, produces refugees," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of the Association complained of the deliberate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been wiped out or driven over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"the chief of the association demanded that the Federal Government be" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a" witch hunt "takes place against Erdogan critic."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the GÃ¼len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, above all Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a GÃ¼len follower destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalist and Saculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the GÃ¼len-close Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum entitled" "asylum seekers" "in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"as of June 30, this amounted to 11.386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all approved asylum claims (39.625)."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in this survey, there are not those who fight against war, poverty or lack of perspective."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot vote the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Sunday election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupid than so far it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and country dances - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced of the campaigners are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the holiday makers who are in the country, on the way to Usedom, RÃ¼gen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems arise: helpers who hang posters, inflate air balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate votes at the end, only painstakingly apply."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass the election campaign close to the people over them."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his position."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting will be how much newbie AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of the coalitionability."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaigning struggle, one can see from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wordy predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, she has got cold feet and chancellor Angela has the blame for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create "has speeded up the ascension of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events twice; Merkel Bundestagrounding is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely waives the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that on the land the base is crumbling, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any left in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU-campaigner Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: thorns, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called out his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats last 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holidays-need and move largely on the internet to their election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the president Claudia MÃ¼ller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners embark on track search for local voters among the vacationers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg and also finds it beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which will start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 20 o'clock, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff tells about the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the opposite is also vowed to those responsible for the construction of the building, for example when it comes to the establishment of comfort driveways."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the AspergstraÃe in Ofterdingen has been lifted, and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant ailments," says the deputy head of the main office manager Florian King, responsible for the technical management of the rehabilitation project. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachelstrasse, SteinlachstraÃe, HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichwege sought and rather trusted their navy than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the community encouraged the measurement vehicle from MÃ¶ssingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute has been splashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was at the pace-30-zone with 77 hours of hourly kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved forward, it has become calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs, everyone you ask is scrutinized."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "slight decline" "at the dealership of Maier, but also admits that of course" the catchage is missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert GÃ¶hner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all restaurants were hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"he estimates sales revenue for" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the renovation of the street was" "thrown back two years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President JÃ¶rg Schmidt responded to a request by GÃ¶hner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">GÃ¶hner knows from other counties where so much has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all cases, GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated road traffic, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his pedigree returns to the end of the renovation work, GÃ¶hner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, GÃ¶hner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on air passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>

<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU gives. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything, which has no chances in the coalitional partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de MaiziÃ¨re.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans quick-action for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are purposefully caught in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the event of Dulce for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than up to now - such as commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to obscure their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legally binding.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still have an effect on them and leaves them open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some point - in the imbalance treatment of tolerated - for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de MaiziÃ¨re, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly occupied did not let themselves be classed at election events.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously into the focus.</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are campaigns."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Germany's home market, deliveries declined by almost a sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">"sales of sales by JÃ¼rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, mainly on two sales days, less in Europe."</seg>

<seg id="18">"Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to comment section in order to oversee him under the pseudonym of non-allmen's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but also to mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hornet by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record purchasers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly studging before I stop, hold my hands and say something weird like:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho slowly clears its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"art from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle aged) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when they appeared and bought new items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and were forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received an impetus from the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar soundboards, from items that watch happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">I think it's like a collector and I think it's like that for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flirts from a stack of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month, they haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I smoother through a stack of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men middle aged), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a colorful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesiology and sexcluded pop rather than experimental jazz sounds from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strangely lonely, but psychological trauma is difficult to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window bumper rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I look at the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research shows that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security, not strolling through Turnhops of Berwick Street and Sheets through records, while they avoid the starving gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who dominates the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has refused an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid, and which offer a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafÃ©s and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' CafÃ©."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest are eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-hour Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening with the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji shared a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a comfort for UK - but will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England out of Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this cap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks of GBs bounce off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, as Osea Kolinisau overcame in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he changed."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a sleepless Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new one since the beginning of the game and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through other weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still cores."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sullians whose fans sang, flags flew and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame placed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and GB kicked in the turf."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more precious gold than in these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when she ruined the second Olympic old in the two-man without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, which set such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolute, at least her 39.ter unwritten bet, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers, who make a difference to the incremental progress that makes the difference and no one was more helpless than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances the right term is."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go back better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing on itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a busy morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked for.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 metres, when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" lead in the process, stay in the process. ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race as we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - light of light for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry from the green power promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the case of exemption from the renewable energy situation in the existing plants for the so-called 'own-current production' in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economics said Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to this, the European Commission initially planned that the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption would ask for cash-out."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG levelling of 20 percent is possible."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this is also not the case in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in view of our" "Steel is Future" "campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emissions law trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," "said IG Metall-boss JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of products threw masses of steel onto the world market in the light of weak domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation is somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on imported steel have an effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been more stagnant."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at last, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the German economic association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt School she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly calls his lungs, is not so quickly out of the puddle in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senior Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, shared singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people fall ill with dementia in long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands a special performance, declares Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show itself: if I do a long time for something, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"there are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, says Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a seniors' choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many seniors on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="3">"to her surprise, the mistrust also left the males cold - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of regression of kittens in the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="7">"apparently the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and strongly aroused young for the males are either not perceptible or not of importance," "said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH."</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittoral cries were different with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight queens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a litte of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from the mother and the siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who still had no offspring, responded differently to the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned to the loudspeakers more quickly when this calls were played by the more excited kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," the biologist said. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans."</seg>

<seg id="3">"she suffered cutting wounds and was treated in the hospital, but I had already left it."</seg>
<seg id="4">Her return home was planned for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe are also Austrian citizens, be unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, said SchnÃ¶ll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday evening in a life district of two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning, two explosive charges went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the popular bathing beach, Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani, on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban clerk."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower beet in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chomphe on the south-eastern coast also called for several injuries."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Fridays ahead of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives, but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group will put behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"according to the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is self-sufficient to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"almost one year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hindu-shrine - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="3">"in the 'Identity Movement' we see evidence of aspirations against the freedom of freedom of democracy," "said Constitutional Court chief Hans-Georg Maeder of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are becoming more and more diffused in the extremist way."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we now observe the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" "Identity Movement" "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" multikulti-delusion, "" uncontrolled mass immigration, "and" the loss of one's own identity by alienation. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - the" Identitaries "are already observing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Masturbate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the national offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'Identity Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," "said the Chief of the Constitutional Court."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general extremists try to speak with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The faculties of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a futile advertisement for one's own business.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly susceptible to attack.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports of contacts of the" Identity "of AfD politicians from several federal states."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maine said, he did not have any knowledge about that."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party, in this case, the AfD - by certain persons who are extremist, will change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in view of the significant increase in rights-related crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maarten said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be legitimate structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that further right-wing groups or small groups are formed to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people, who had not previously appeared in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offences or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, which might have been politically indifferent or have voted for example CDU, SPD or Left, which, however, have radicalised by right-wing extremist moods."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>

<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called it "Roble of the Wal."</seg>

<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool in Equatorial Guinea, when he had to ride alone over 100 meters of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase at the latest when appropriate improvements are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a sleepy calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd SteinhÃ¤user (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the Office of Agriculture Kulmbach, it was established that for these sewage plants undercover was running."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016 citizens and trade and industrial companies from Weldingahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous period of calculation should be offset."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste of wastewater, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, wastewater volumes in all three plants are slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in addition, due to their age of refurbishment and repair, all three plants continued to grow in a significant extent in the previous calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welhin, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be removed, the sewage sludge removed and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "in addition to these extraordinary expenses, the ongoing care and maintenance costs associated with the new calculation period have been taken into account."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were full.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs at the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to stone houses, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long run, as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage utility association can not be extended because it is a lack of public facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies each day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All false appearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have criticised criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week gave some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and hazy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow spotted. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was designed as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter remembered breaking clichÃ©s."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely used over the photos was that the filter" hurtingly and gelinde "was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was pulled into the degrading extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older counterparts - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting to a user," it's much harder that such things go unnoticed when it was the case, "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a subscriber, the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence service information, notes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a committee of inquiry made in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Republican Members of the Armed Forces Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command's intelligence agencies, reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence related information, typically found by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly reported a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the CentCom belong to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed reporting problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom representative publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom are under way through the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "the highest-level Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," "Mr. Schiff," "delayed the release of intelligence reports," "compensated morality among analysts and" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats announced not to have found any clues on a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts with regard to a "specific political view."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were admitted to CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigations have retroactive effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim, which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the intermediates of more than ten years ago than a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever to have done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"they know, however, that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the Britons in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remain undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman, who will lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always, the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss about their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, started turning things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workplace in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to break the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back-hand blow from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team appeared surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lapped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are permanent and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed down from the crossbow to the turner to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock of dimples, could have definitely been among those familiar names that are sent to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had won an athlete until 2012, who managed it up to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share the women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit, that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never ending bouncing - but also the grazie of gymnastics and doves, the two sports which it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "Trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling motions (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to execution, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallists need to go farther, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes down and down, upwards and downwards at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further heights in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympiarecord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-directed pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I personally feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The tramp's vector is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ape and the objecting of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air rinating, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long, an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters during the clashes with the police were killed in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia to collapse just in the process?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more territories."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continued to suppress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you want to suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden who were forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness gradually explode under the surface after years of bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, because cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were so protesters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of eons, Amharas, who predominantly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who are about 6 percent of the population, who are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailanariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailanariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a upheaval was 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting that, according to the statements of analysts, apparently fed by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopian development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharan city, run by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights via the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has created ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his comrades, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the reference to an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump in relation to the claim on Thursday returned and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared" Of course I mean sarcastic. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections Mr. Trump has accepted an even more biased note, as its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumpel Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumpet's most prominent advocates, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumpet's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them ambassadors, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting it to aggressive the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of rushing around on each of his words and being biased against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology than just another proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the last book" Chop Suey "was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while bricks were told in their book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frilly snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered Hackney, this couple found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Brickman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the paths with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense subject," Coe asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle revitate as" wonderful species, food leftovers, "as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd mixtures have been tried out as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has given precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book which includes recipes, brick prepared a dish from that period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - looked at the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household politicians "and to transform Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Cake-eating attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly lauded the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food," Brickman said, as well as how science was applied to food. "</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Brickman remembered:" "they actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the fall of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">"after finishing the plates at Eisenberg's, they and Coe dragged out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt did eat at lunch."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," Brickman said, and added that it was a common ploy to give a modest name to recipes. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>
<seg id="51">Each dived somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tamed brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE got a hit three times.</seg>
<seg id="54">"like a Can-Do Budgetter, he said to his wife," "Some hacked walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the research ship Sanna."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks are getting offspring only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in one hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at a depth of 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, which is characterized by slowness, seems to be a recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland's sharks will be stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-slow pace was when they equipped six animals with a transmitter, in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers, which are torturing from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should, therefore, lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, with 220 centimetres of the third smallest animal, the lenticular core contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their linker-core, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark, while the Rekord-Hai with 502 centimetres would be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to allocate the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusals live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, they mature later - and age more slowly."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the city on the Main therefore has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London, in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit-Votum," says Michael VoigtlÃ¤nder, head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW. "</seg>

<seg id="10">"while in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, the rent for premium commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the River Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyesteal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were tackled."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Romy trip of all ministers in two years, the Upper Ministerial Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimages were tested, and it was finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, during the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 And they came out of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and all the rooms of the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storey sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and distributed the pilgrim's blessing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where there was also a Muenster Unserer loved woman standing and so the pilgrimage route from MÃ¼nster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day morning and evening, each day was accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a stop to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrims song."</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish offices of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint at the Vodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy made himself to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after being in March at the World Championships in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindi, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner set up an Olympic medord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hindi fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, driving in a higher gear in order to slow down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we have set up an Olympic medord and defeated the world champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindi admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindi said," "It feels like all the UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would mean for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny now takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hindi said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won Gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with appointees before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas took place in the background, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, in the midst of sexism and Mobbling projectiles, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy yield questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, stand at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is going to expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2000 jobs, direct and indirect, could be at risk of closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could result in domino effects as the melt consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force as of November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point on, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the current supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual abyss of $187 million in" "anticipation of termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010, it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 900 MW of electricity per year to consume around 900 MW of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as generating sets it wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weeping," Kendall wrote. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"this represents the clichÃ© plot almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacremnant brought the sentence" "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow on this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, certainly a new era of the Kardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have smitten the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference resembling an image volume rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is expected so longingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still going through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the modells "as" models, celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover for a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even though everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them" "Mistakes of the Eye". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings showed up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>

<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago Nokia Communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, that would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euros, lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover, Germany."</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was reachable."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to websites was possible by HTML browsers, albeit slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.</seg>
<seg id="18">"very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="3">"for me, it was the biggest attraction Heathrow, as it was in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we are already offering 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>

<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop side, Adblock Plus published a blogpost where it shared that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertising display to make it difficult to identify indicating which part of the page advertising is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday passed a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman laid herself in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, which prompts them as well as any witness of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>

<seg id="12">"this is something that the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers cannot be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was called in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing, having gone over a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have refuted earth-like conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdative atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned further."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposures its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which had previously been suspected by planetary researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed -- in the course of several billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler World Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in star-run rotate to different rates and in which context the rotation periods are associated with the planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star-stars, learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Plejades is located 445 light-years from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"to peak-rotational rates, these mature stars repel large amounts of starches."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently attacking businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks on company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially too blackout ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send ads."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was frightening quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to break the business operation completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of acute attacks."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in an up-to-date study, F-Secure safety researchers examined the areas of use and contact with the blackmail presses and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to get more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must deal in part hard and pay five-digit amounts to recover their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work," explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus service Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is more probable, however, that it is about three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits have been created by buying malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackberries are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the meantime, the risk of ransomware is well-known among many companies that better safeguard their data."</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware by means of a file back-up and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators threaten instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chairman Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that the potential damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Defcon Hackerkonferenz, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupÃ© and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty much overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and rear, it does not work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top falls off somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l on high-raised and 1026 l in reverse backrests, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie boilers and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he should, however, turn his work somewhat quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" during manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and a HDMI connector lie underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the roughly 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for Sleeping Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the mornings there is no longer to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-GÃ¼nter Weeping, member of the board of the German Society for sleep and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but the insomnia, therefore, is an inhaling and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people simply feel inadequate or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German household doctor association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found behind it, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often common in case of depression," says Weber. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dampening one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, if you have a herniated disc, you can sleep poorly, wake up every two to three hours, and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, gives them an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are compromised on the day, go to the doctor, tell weep."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look very different: you are beaten, tired, unslept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out about the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin, is not present in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, if you have problems with sleeping problems, you should first contact the family doctor, advise them."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with breathing agents, in case of poor daily fatigue, in case of sleep-transducers or if the cause of a disturbance is not found, Fietz explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "please don't make a nap," "says Fietz."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after slimming, you go to bed at your normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of jackbolts on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts: regular bedtime and upliftedness, not to sleep long in bed, not to sleep on the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then one starts to reckon immediately and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police count them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a fresched kindergarten and a biolad."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here until 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy neighbourhood, "as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"having been evacuated on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrol the police for three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others talk about late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted more police protection from the vandalizing left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between house-occupiers and their neighbors make up, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty rates compared to the rest of the city. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under large police orders in a real road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by jars or freshly painted facades thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year, together with the words" "Left Autonomous Violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: criminal offenses, such as body injury, are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes are causing damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house in a rented house for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously moved to the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this is why it was so important for her to get her streets back: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that drive the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"that is, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well cared for here are living here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve violence and destruction."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Agency for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there now, the egg-reliant Wollmilksau, who has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for example, some - less ridiculing than on the large number of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"wanted was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an urgent Wollmilksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central part, writes Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has fixed a 50 per cent period for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"until now, it is not possible to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communal dwellings need to be chaired, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the WasenstraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"apart from a solid lead, there are internships, training places, schoolyards, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that's motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and community of volunteers jump."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it will take a long time to bridge their time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases also," says customer honestly, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation after the latest events, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine Kunde says quite clearly," "what some may call naive." "a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers have already been sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations make them completely obituated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is awkward."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already at full capacity to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
