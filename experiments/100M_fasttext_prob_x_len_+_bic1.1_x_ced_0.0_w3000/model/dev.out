Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and op@@ poses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked to with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election forthcoming in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor decided to have his girlfriend shot . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat c@@ ant voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; still lives and probably is excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was rit@@ ually on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I just loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he had shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motiv@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both studied in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some incl@@ ines to difficult behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; previously , Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs trail later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls melted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and blues played . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail , three years ago , met both on a summer fair . &quot;
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter is writing and singing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the open and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students , and members of the congregation on a candle light memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to make our students return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call described Pr@@ enti@@ ss rather than his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer employees for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it was planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 employees were employed in the 2014 Christmas season . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an ar@@ mes@@ of of it , with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; the biggest time @-@ trip movie ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October . &quot;
UN head says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon declares that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only make worse violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN head again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers would make this situation impossible .
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last 11 national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the asc@@ ending Her@@ man Cain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University demonstrated that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Repub@@ lican voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten , Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July wag@@ ged their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it is shown that a large number of GO@@ P voters view the campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the leadership of the Tr@@ ump@@ et , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he had 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have fixed their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , tr@@ umps is strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; ever since Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; immigration was the turning point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pron@@ unciation of Tr@@ ump is stopping decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Repub@@ lican party and damaging new orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new limits .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son are now around half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , there is the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um with a view over the North Sea resort . &quot;
&quot; on average , a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; stated in the study - hence the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in ver@@ tig@@ inous heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nix - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
&quot; but well , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way : Munich , by way , is not at the top of the list . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
two @-@ time scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller smooth@@ ed the way to FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race . &quot;
M√ºller received good cooperation from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ s@@ Roberto in the Champions League in the Champions League in the Champions League .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were brave , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by game shift on the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the upper left gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck Poland &apos;s he@@ ap of the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved into their usual domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer style . &quot;
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a reli@@ ance .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ ch ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng He did well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , back to the Ka@@ der after muscular problems , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; said Board member Matthias Sam@@ mer : &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; G√∂t@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller made one . &quot;
&quot; before the game , Kra@@ j@@ allen had come in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially deca@@ yed Bavarian fans had apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with whi@@ st@@ les against the Munich charm . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured and transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes is a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 cases higher . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; the main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore attributed to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , stated director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health through to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental unemployment has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ates the findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on the remains of the late anti@@ quity to Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the ump@@ teenth time .
&quot; archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum , skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a technical office for archae@@ ology of soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , was explained by Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

European Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; said EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
&quot; through the TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to emerge with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ral tribunal see specifically that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow obj@@ ections to be lod@@ ged against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their verdict . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system failed to trust in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; said Mr Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel lev@@ y , over which firms may first dispute the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; on the other hand , the German State Secretary of State Matthias M@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform , which the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association of Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the investment opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as non @-@ durable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with a felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ de@@ dly and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative mas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; with the release of 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart @-@ composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously to American folk of the late 1960s , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent style . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states of the states should be mentioned in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and had a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced to a minimum .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide masterpiece appears in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic spare pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first of all , St@@ ev@@ ens thanks him , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally ends up with thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and set up with David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six issues shortly after lunch , where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because after his appointment as member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several news stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in business , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; within Labour as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour MPs set forward to remove all the idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to limit the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since been chief of T@@ ory in the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy , says that he has ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ aire is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from &quot; beating &quot; and stri@@ pping with hooks , and instead focused on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the Shadow Bud@@ get@@ ing Minister , is represented when he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also put the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grasp the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the narr@@ ator of the House of House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; P@@ unch &quot; &quot; theatre , often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; being broadcast on TV first in 1990 , the question@@ aire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated increase in wages in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ und rose sharply in terms of data showing rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and delivered estim@@ ations at the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.9 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump in the acquisition bid of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core stocks rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ through stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his estim@@ ation on the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages threaten expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .

some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to second place .
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster introduces Lebanese to potato dig@@ ger idea
potatoes or Do@@ ors ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the potato √∂n@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the spell &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes rot@@ ates in his shop . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the Lebanese now has the idea to register with the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the agency , it has recently been protected as utility models . &quot;
Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and potatoes contain the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary understanding of international people is good . &quot;
Met@@ rics starts So@@ il Ad@@ dress Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ ric has launched a bottom @-@ down campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ hi@@ ve , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ a will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will carry out its annual Invest@@ ors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA outlets and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 million sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ris loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s is sales and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ rics will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
it declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in terms of sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious examination of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Masters Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after@@ ward , Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beaten Kyr@@ gy@@ ak , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after crashing a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite excited about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ ren@@ ian at the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely concentrated on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick has quickly done the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and ear@@ ns all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary decl@@ ines emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to illeg@@ ally come to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ clamation police . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ grown Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after all - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would make the EU countries more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ ding action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and ha@@ sten asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck in many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entrance to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that stands strongly in opposition to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also establish higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the military use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
they come over by damaging the fence ; they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are quick to fix the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , following a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important crossing point near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water before entering Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating on a national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is a candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are only 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a major advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton when it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at this time - only a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman to be President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned in their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the constitu@@ ency is also cited .
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President acc@@ uses the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries emerged as unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and endow@@ ed with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect overall . &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good music scores . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest news survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times on Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new survey is dispens@@ ed with , and others will lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey . &quot;
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed among Repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former governor of Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , occupy the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for tr@@ umps belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; swimming temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top , 23 degrees in France . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with sand with a kn@@ ap@@ sack full of sand , and attacked repeatedly as he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fa@@ inted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital to the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set up the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning with his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt forces injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , an attorney who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members for the murder of the third counts .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned it , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; a rise in interest is coming , and the good@@ will will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the initial interest rate increase and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and finance systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is an overview based on historical trends that could respond to some areas of the economy :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets yields to be deduc@@ ed from 12 to 24 months after initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rate increases in F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - roughly 14 per cent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the last six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , Head Investment Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return will start to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
what is particularly remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , nominal interest rate increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest rate increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; all year round , market participants made a interest rate increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading gives only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all growth cycles of 1950 up to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions performed very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic direction .
&quot; in bonds , returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer bond between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the magnitude of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market , when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large companies , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates so@@ ar and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher income , even if experts differ from different opinions how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and education to the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work must be made to engage audiences than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; if the next time it star@@ es a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee @-@ bearer for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest income since the beginning of records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed the output in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping had bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase over the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this will happen , and we will possibly experience that growth will be reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 issued a little more than ¬£ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now performed via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the streets of Mec@@ ca , in the streets of Mec@@ ca . &quot;
Saudi Arabia particip@@ ates in the collapse of some of the Saudi Bin Laden Group &apos;s huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; survivors filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead comp@@ eted their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ stly cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed by the holy site , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the worshi@@ ppers . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family left a san@@ ction for the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers killed , when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane under@@ took . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
the Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , Bin Laden &apos;s Bin Laden Group did not want to stop the crane &apos;s arm when it was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company &apos;s foreign travel was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man asked to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ addle who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ y as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to the relatives of the killed persons and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .

&quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at craftsmen , will be opened &quot;

&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes
&quot; if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British are increasingly employing professional tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which will focus on professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this more strongly to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and revenues after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up 200 new stores due to the trend . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice @-@ Minister A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and issue ev@@ asion . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he gar@@ ner@@ ed the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial c@@ ess@@ ation .
&quot; this fact was divided by the Chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ er sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in order to prevent the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that at no time had an asset had ar@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we continue the club or do we stop ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the bread @-@ based firm of the finance office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies have been laid down as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; on a corresponding financial basis , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance for expenses was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was added to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore flat @-@ rate and not detail bookings seemed to be possible , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts jointly managed the two accused , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial declaration , it was important to have only the liberty of debt , the answer . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , the accused declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time . &quot;
then he finally commented that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
the defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; claims res@@ titu@@ tion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why Dam@@ age Cla@@ ims ? , Ju@@ dge and At@@ tor@@ ney General wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he added 1.000 Euro per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept up after an operation test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter money .
&quot; all the de@@ port@@ ations could be made in cash , in order to do so , from his place of residence , he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff cuts that have been running for three years now , the Compu@@ branch will have further jobs to be disman@@ tled in order to split the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company informed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; on the stock market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share sold 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is now spl@@ itting itself into a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers , continued to rely on the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer for Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
selling prices declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds to the change in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive footprint .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted late , that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and more and more businesses are doing the same online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rep@@ el : 54 per cent spoke out against it , 35 per cent were unanim@@ ous . &quot;
61 percent are positive that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are involved in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , are 20 per cent . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
&quot; the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility by the 27th of September . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA are counting about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and water laun@@ chers for several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line formed and a water ej@@ ector was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles . &quot;
the officials were inc@@ ess@@ antly using pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have withdrawn somewhat now .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees fell into each other and suffered severe short@@ ness of breath .
the Ser@@ b police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries because of the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US emergency bench comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest will be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point to the fact that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Con@@ duction at Delta State University left exc@@ uses
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He has shot someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb of 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before taking his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who testified that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , the 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les &quot;
the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that he was not going to prison .
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , such as his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , pictured with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this surely calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa plans to build a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the company &apos;s conversion to the workplace . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union . &quot;
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the objective of real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board headed by CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new set @-@ up , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the dispute with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ lined strike on Thursday . &quot;
this shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; wanted to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left outer defender to the weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it lasts for six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an i@@ vory @-@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a we@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers from the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK defender had an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know what it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; surely , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ? &quot;
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , returns instead a summary of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ orn @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads one . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not have been suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ orn @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees falling , thin @-@ angry essence , which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row with a child . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circle office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees but did not have any further comments .
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; pushing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not rule out an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ off players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the run of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he hopes to kno@@ ck out further races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his position even though he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test hit man gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first sat Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a hit man I treasure .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of man in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of dropping mos@@ ques apart from Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cra@@ dle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
&quot; he made three hundred ranks right away , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may view his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the training staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a major coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;

&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances if the economy falls into a dol@@ drums by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently breaks out for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU are now and not always from their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers are climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for an outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin , letting more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long curing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t gain anything from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they may be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ f√ºr@@ st@@ end@@ ent villa@@ ins , telephone chi@@ ppers and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ l√§nder , who own most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , ban@@ anas are better distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a door for him . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly greeting on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he needed no time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s official position on Europe - I just express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendencies and wild comb@@ ats of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loy@@ ally towards his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening after all reports . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no carte blan@@ che for Europe , which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities concerning EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , her anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction from the T@@ ory government to the power I was reminded on Monday morning , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking , resulting from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation , on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi@@ criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Medicine ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; stands be@@ zeich@@ ung &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alle@@ gations of p@@ he that &quot; there was no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that he had already responded to the BM@@ J &apos;s claims . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by giving up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which are also clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the High @-@ House communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , you should have your production at least on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funding programs that could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broadcast shows what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion GBP broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all those ob@@ liter@@ ate programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think , we all think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on radio - and it should take an example to &quot; inform , inform , and enter@@ tain the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and with the commercial tran@@ smit@@ ters alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change direction right now , in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and are found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , thus a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their motor @-@ eur@@ on@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

another of the Anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a blank of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ light company advertising , but &quot; by the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; said Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
&quot; eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I got angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to the residence halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you get from where you are coming from where you are on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and get their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t think about starting your university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away to get the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you a bit . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are among the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drum and bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving her own music , closing her door and proc@@ eeded to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , you would have to go to them , separate themselves again and then see them every day , and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your subordin@@ ate a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is more fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good path is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; row houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ ouses for people , who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the single mother and the lesser ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly favourable living space can be created : he construc@@ ts row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people stay here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : in terms of construction law , I have carried out my project correctly . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , tap &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message stating that &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the sli@@ mming of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued since the phone may stop half @-@ way , and this may lead to a break@@ age of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup 2nd stressed the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion ahead of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Br@@ ite won seven of the twelve season races so far , taking the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Big Prize of Singapore is still unclear .

&quot; as a result , it is possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent for talent should also be promoted .

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ loft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation dra@@ gs it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , you receive sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the nursing and nursing staff . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service to ensure that often caring depend@@ ents are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; many services of the insurance companies are not rarely used , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the B√ºrger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club reconciliation in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising supplement . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the social foundation makes a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and good as possible in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 noon . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house divided on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus gave an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the out@@ sider . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;

&quot; after that , the meadow burst out of the business , insul@@ ted the official and threw the fine fine in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot;
&quot; the city of Bremen proves the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot;
only after that will decide whether the meadow will be shown or not .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11@@ pm , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck the fist on his face .
the victim suffered a n@@ os@@ ef@@ act and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove past several demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there , he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot;
&quot; under the help of a beat @-@ stick , one beat on the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and enco@@ ders to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 Euro &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
&quot; also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : on October 1 , Dr. Frank M√ºller will take over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ aus . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel comes to retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on his way to his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , M√ºller will open the practice on October 12th , until then , he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank M√ºller and his wife , Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently doing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to get into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the M√ºller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss as soon as possible . &quot;
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 , he was appointed as a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz district and volunte@@ ered to work in the DRC @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ eat works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a home physician . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speech room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler receives a supplement of ‚Ç¨ 50,000 as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphasizes the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen each quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ vom@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits M√ºller &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally also looks at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel said with a smile . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already felt after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds , laughing : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also going on at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright . &quot;
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a request for asylum can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that clear signals are needed , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even not over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to leave the refugees arriving in Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not quite like that . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - particularly Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia would not want to shut down its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country will host about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be rer@@ ou@@ ted to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously had mig@@ rated to the Hungarian border , accompanied Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to encourage people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , in fact , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary can now come to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testified to the country a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic appe@@ aled this Wednesday morning with a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; at the moment , it would not be a very high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; they could not yet say whether they would continue their journey on Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
migrants advise migrants to - Dan@@ ger@@ ous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars has been launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused were ongoing .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce subsi@@ dy drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is well faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as the volunteers .
&quot; while some pedestrian navig@@ ates spontaneously to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; So far I am not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; over and over again , small discussions about the action are developing , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that sometime the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which , together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , is the bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the boards , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; death and death are still subject to tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed up financial outlook for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell above 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a gain between $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expect a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower level of view , despite the price increases , is an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; yields solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex increased 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to USD 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ate . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher operating costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a mur@@ al of the United States is located above them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story seat . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate , which is close to zero , since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy shows that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and even though it is only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel @-@ Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who recently were inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rate jumped by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she must go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the May high . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tur@@ mo@@ il influences the complex calculation , when interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US Federal Reserve . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process technically . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s F@@ ed currency authority . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere mention of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , at that time , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only super@@ v@@ ise developments elsewhere , but also provide advice to other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to raising interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia added the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives decided to reverse these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put forward aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ union , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rates because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section when you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole grocery store you are hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ √º@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has different picking options .
what &apos;s here : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store belongs to the massive freeze department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ all , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pork , fish balls , regional sau@@ sage , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and chefs , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide courses are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away by Philippe The Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ences she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different from a real school . &quot;
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande stimulates nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to sho@@ cking women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are su@@ cking at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tumour development . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ried Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become flat for solar panels .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ n@@ astic building on Bern@@ ried sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint meeting , the revised construction contract was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the committee submitted an application for a construction @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof top &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which is stipul@@ ated for energetic reasons - is to lie below ten degrees in different ways than in the development plan . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because the development plan allows no &quot; exceptions &quot; regarding the ti@@ lt of the roof , whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council usually leaves more restric@@ tive in the case of freedom of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , the Turn@@ halle Building is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are estimated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will be presented to the Board of Directors for testing . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this is reflected in the surprising plans of the Land@@ kreis hospital , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and will be postpon@@ ed next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ on@@ gau with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ on@@ gau , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change is triggered by the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who is to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and exchange with his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the range in &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner station .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer and his team are said to work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the currently ongoing renovation was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; this is what I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü was not able to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily routine psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer of the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which had been received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
it has not been a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

Jag@@ om@@ atch with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police announced . &quot;
&quot; after a shot of guns , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered grave injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
it was unclear at first how exactly it could happen to the accident .
find out the criminal police .
&quot; missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , victims of violent crimes &quot;
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to killed the young people and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was regarded as suspect and led investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances , a suspicion arose against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities to stop the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a burden on him . &quot;
the further investigations are to shed light on the circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of lack of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable ble@@ aching place .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in their first accommodation . &quot;
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently around 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; many professionals , therefore , lived in large cities not@@ ated in WG rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has been declining for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing construction . &quot;
so could be wai@@ ved on the tax on land and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros was rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia finish corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no passing through , since more and more refugees are choosing their way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot;
&quot; after isol@@ ating the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; moreover , new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; according to media reports , most of them are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; while at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders . &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , after the closing of the border , there are hardly any more refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people attacked . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the gate was closed on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators are threatening prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new transit zones , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
&quot; practically , nobody has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only able to reach a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
&quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy after the bridge party on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the Gest@@ apo together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we did not forget the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have said right away we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers were switched from one ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u in order to make it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was turned off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ b@@ lower @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n sends several tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke to establish structures immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially moved the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but a refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; it will be even greater - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 har@@ dy quarters &quot;
&quot; with the aid of refugees , Konrad has all the hands to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place districts for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first training centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was also carried out without great fuss , said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad comp@@ els with a demand of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ ful year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 lod@@ gings will still have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to provide the federal states , 15.000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born tomorrow , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , there may be no need for district generators to comply with a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the sky@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be applied . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful at placing , Konrad uses his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er are not responsible for the Republic , as they stated themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , your own quest for accommodation has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the City leader critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees among the federal states .
other districts also need to contribute .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders will not be sealed .
it is still possible to continue the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger &apos;s &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans is a logical consequence for P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed T &amp; T IT Group is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also to acquire some of them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the facility , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to move the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she now got an increase in the shape of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
Br@@ eit gave her fashion interest from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are in rap@@ ture at the sight of a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of every outfit is used .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose inhabitants are called residents .
some people also share this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
&quot; whether he expresses himself in foreign hos@@ tility to journalists , or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy , the candidate for the U.S. presidential office sp@@ ends the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the pf@@ √§l@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ cut is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ master Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which beside Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the l@@ ender , says it . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ arch@@ ers .
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the first real estate company in New York was the corner@@ stone of the real estate company .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian state , which was then owned by the Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ atine History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er retired rather than dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; he is always about five thousand . &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , Pen@@ sion@@ ra@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family sp@@ ends something for the church organ , which is generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a , Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ go@@ ers , also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; mountain @-@ clim@@ bers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; clim@@ ber village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the ratings for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the state capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no part in Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months , the vulner@@ ability to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , today , today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; until now , sunrise on an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these da@@ w@@ men more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without Raf@@ ael &apos;s Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe produced an average of 44@@ 6.000 people . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.@@ m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for one million dollars that it didn &apos;t manage to over@@ look the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
the woman who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game per@@ ishing , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; both fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them fast , except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sarah &apos;s and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now pre@@ occupied to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM . &quot;
first published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a don@@ ut as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at its first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only care for the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ vers with his original debut back in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a t@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Chamber in Great Wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Sunday faction of the Free Elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ ki@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot;
but the state policy in Gro√ü@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing ov@@ ary is on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the &quot; &quot; middle level plus &quot; &quot; pilot test at 47 degrees in which an extension of the upper secondary school was tested from three to four years . &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this .
free travel to G@@ 9 wherever you want .
festive Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed up with profits over long distances and nervous trading .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock markets provided a clear direction , which ultimately boo@@ sted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
&quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.9 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as a financial bank of the Eurozone fell by 1.@@ 01 per cent to 3@@ 20@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid gains also posted trade places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted some 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets expect the markets to be replaced until after the interest decision in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures market on this Friday .
&quot; the discussion about the burdens of the nuclear phase has temporarily pressed the shares of RW@@ E on a record low , and also left deep marks at E@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered a bit , but ultimately lost 3.1 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the top of the Da@@ x Group .
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; looked after the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors paid little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in this context , investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out . &quot;
&quot; car figures were in demand : even in the traditionally low summer months of August more cars were set off than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the papers of the automobile manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent , respectively 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot;
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .

4 people killed after police shoot gum@@ mies on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear immediately why the used rubber bul@@ lets , which is known to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ el@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which had been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators spe@@ eded up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter property in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
what investor would issue is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner big street , bought already a few months ago and leave the building on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure facilities
&quot; for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small seaside are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; publicly presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who submitted sec@@ rec@@ y to investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members , and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been underway for months in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions among sea @-@ traders who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ump that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase dramatically due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what is happening on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ Advice . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who are over@@ tax@@ ed by the European nations , as they flee from war torn and poor countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million in goo@@ gle@@ .com / pe@@ er@@ eli@@ ef .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also fled from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an edi@@ tori@@ als on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or Adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ Sur@@ gery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity in type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan used Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ Sur@@ gery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c scar@@ f - for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical treatment for diabetes approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dissolved and 28 % in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was reduced to only one percent and in some cases at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the blood pressure monitoring , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people undergoing obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have to wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school hours and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mira@@ bly ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent response of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase in dose of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of hand san@@ iti@@ zer revenues in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mo@@ or@@ age in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens of dis@@ infection can only drink because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are supposed to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent which are very appealing to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes out of straw@@ berry sc@@ rub@@ bing disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult by law as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and kno@@ cked her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ lau@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by discussing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled her from her room .
&quot; the police considered the en@@ vious plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and denied disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ bar in the direction of the industrial area and was too late to notice that at the round@@ about two driving vehicles had stopped .
&quot; subsequently , he crashed his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a stationary Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the event of accidents involving accidents , damages of about 10 000 euros were caused by the police . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready for use and had to be tow@@ ed .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel pres@@ sured , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers Mittel@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll turn things around , swe@@ ars draw@@ la . &quot;
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the following ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , now with a five @-@ point lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;

&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try remin@@ ding myself of all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the prisoner &apos;s story as he wants and you &apos;ll get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a report from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series that I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to mention all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can contact them .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase is persu@@ ading to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police officer stayed dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called for a demo@@ lition of a house in Beck@@ en@@ ham . &quot;
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and he threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria , claiming that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t tu@@ pi test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it was going on .
sometimes one re@@ acts and one has to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around with lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should that bring me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act cow@@ ard@@ ly and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it right now . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t analysis , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; lu@@ dic@@ rous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ tor , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it was so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver @-@ flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man following a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and following driver @-@ flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver ev@@ asion and failure to provide assistance and other transport off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to claims on ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed note to the Storm team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ p of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , as it meant they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything in our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real center of gravity and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time of the year comes up again and again .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the play Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , or are there any points of tension ? &quot;
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the semi@@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbian with $ 200,000 b@@ ail on drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who could potentially be sentenced to life imprisonment for his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kil@@ os of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life imprisonment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the cafe might have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear ties with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian pas@@ sports , reported daily by the police and kept at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 in Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ ture tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
&quot; a damages amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 Euros were incurred . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl asking for pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; concerning &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and he &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , asking him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on the 14th of June last year and not to have appeared before the court at a hearing on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the sexual offen@@ se &apos;s Register , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ es the judgement from October to October in order to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted b@@ ail , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
it was recorded before the judgment of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people out of fear of discovery and arrest the people at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said . &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn regions since Tuesday .
they were walking over bridges and ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
&quot; there , they are taken into account by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; in the Munich Central Station , more refugees arrived at the German Federal Police Office in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people have arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 alone , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : prec@@ ursor of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country at the moment , shared by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still up to Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is primarily moving to compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone , according to the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; R√ºssel@@ sheim . Opel offers a start @-@ up below the biggest competitor &apos;s VW Golf , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offers more diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what &apos;s new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according manufacturer &apos;s instructions , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front panel : here , the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the ti@@ pped Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are man @-@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Authority Te@@ gel , which has been accommod@@ ated for months in a single cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot again , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his ar@@ rests of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case back to it . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment have been made decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ rying the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; only in April they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee , because he was deta@@ ined naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ question@@ able . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had reached an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; deta@@ inees are therefore imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness will rise , even to ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Court of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young talent , 19 are to be dropped in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany provides the following overview .
&quot; it is needed according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and indeed the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it was built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the ten@@ ancy rate every year , and for these particularly favorable properties , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be built every year , and therefore the Con@@ federation would have to invest USD 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , &quot; says Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find a job in Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view has mostly been asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; to date , there is still no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the creation of networks is , according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , the Royal Road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children into the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family in the Senate Administration in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand bal@@ lot in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the course classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage on them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position . &quot;
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ ish , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the blind . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but the funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ o@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually depri@@ ve Islam of the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to embrace religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , and the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
&quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motif systematically . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and for which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are com@@ mitting , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to the previously anticipated refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery wants to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers immediately when registering health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut off so many people with the limited catalogue of services , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors mainly make the language barriers possible . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there is much more un@@ treat@@ able disability , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; but with the partially other cases of illness , German doctors come from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as for the doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some of them are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill following estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ otherap@@ y@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations , and death fears . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; Passion &quot; production , Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick v@@ ault to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ staged production . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; the gift of the fan@@ atics is , therefore , the family in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ Cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the barely 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the program of the circus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family fascin@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films it wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon s@@ alt@@ works , the circus ac@@ rob@@ atics fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ stry . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little else and fascin@@ ates with its mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
mis@@ understand@@ ings in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not going well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be picked up by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says . &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the show but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 people , we always do our best and are with my whole heart . &quot;
&quot; from 17 to 20 September , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances at 5 : 00 PM . &quot;
on Sunday the program ki@@ cks off at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animals are open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the arguments of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , warning them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; death &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Members of Parliament that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the party said that the party , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s explanation . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called the &quot; Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. companies in the world , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded the most injury days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an accidental period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ √† will be allowed to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far @-@ off hope to lead the club to its first European cup of Europe with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Campa@@ ign Against a miserable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends will reduce the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
&quot; in the age of communication conducted via social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health far more deeply . &quot;
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football match in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration at this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all of the 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who put the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed to play against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to create problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals scored . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own spot against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before he passed over to Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was faced with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ atz@@ eted in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the post ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth saf@@ ari after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and out of very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had recognized a gate in the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion dollars by stock@@ ings
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a sale of stock as part of its huge debt recovery plan . &quot;
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ en@@ core stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about CHF 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling raw materials prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes demand and impacts on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of London &apos;s stock exchange on Wednesday morning trading .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay about a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the Group . &quot;
&quot; concerns about a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

white House Con@@ fir@@ med Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings Vis@@ it to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an Declaration on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a state dinner in the evening after the two leaders had bilateral discussions .
&quot; President X@@ is visit will be given the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while also President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to address areas of dis@@ agreements constructive , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

so it did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the county Got@@ ha .
&quot; on the A 71 at Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then out and over . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the s@@ ling@@ ing on wet roads and drove to the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;
&quot; the material damage is estimated to be 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented switching to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ahead of the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winners , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing in Barcelona before the Euro 2008 . &quot;
they told me Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ bl@@ y@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I &apos;ve played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change the fact that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time would have gone with X@@ av@@ i 2008 / 2009 .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , sw@@ elled the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on Pla@@ ys Vari@@ ety in Film Mak@@ ing
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night at HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives , highlighted the necessity of alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments by the actor of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film , Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni puts his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured adher@@ ence . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ages who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; caps first champion
professional sport climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task included climbing on a rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock about winning the Big prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; director K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d get any res@@ ent@@ ment .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had sw@@ apped the rolls .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins turned a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun no matter what happens , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game . &quot;
the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the sle@@ eper well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a double play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth interior , the Berlin Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited by an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month due to a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , flus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tiger placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s reli@@ ever right handed . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three beats with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing trains .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder strap , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three playing at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved are then to be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 up to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily lodge in there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days , according to the government presi@@ dency responsible for the initial survey , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possible opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective thinking . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict lands in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Manager for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
it did not refer to concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers will want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial recording and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the minister @-@ pres@@ idents in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also be embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
but those who have no prospect of a lead could not stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to set the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice pad of Satur@@ n@@ mond &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ lashes . &quot;
the researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; thus , the moon dri@@ fts easily on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange rate is only small , but still too great for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ nian moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 for several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen must ab@@ stain from an offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama around a month .
the association was informed about an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the age of 27 .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; probably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is hard for us , R@@ ama is a great loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united pro . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive weapon . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously signed by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his bra@@ ins shake , Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to embar@@ k on a running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to pay attention to its slim line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits nevertheless are healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits therefore support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet dishes . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS , for the Christmas business in the USA , re@@ stores up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; faced with the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex meet early in the past year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ ail storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ √∂hn wind , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz medi@@ ated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows sometimes with storm @-@ strength through the f@@ ussy Pe@@ eler . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ √∂hn blows through the valleys at night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows on Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent centre of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain slope . &quot;
rain starts here until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , this has already fallen into large quantities of rain after the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn winds its way , as a result a cold front rolls with a strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are notic@@ e@@ ably back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south , on the weekend , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ator . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now recognised as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a dead sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome . &quot;
&quot; then , with his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel , Luther had initiated the spl@@ itting of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental church . &quot;
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt has worked for about three years on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; &quot; today &quot; &quot; into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who puts his personal thoughts on the particular situation here . &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ ps have golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I have tried to work up that perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a faster time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of ima@@ gery is marked by advertisement , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the picture &quot; &quot; to let them act , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but to select the themes that are important to him , including mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of the Luther House this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway approaching
&quot; plans , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished . &quot;
&quot; there were failures in politics and administration , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill down , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the permission will be made in October , and the First Common Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot;
football re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in addressing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle that it doesn &apos;t matter , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its Refu@@ gee Initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; four years . &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the Edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs are showing a clear sign when they will be wearing &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports director , Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , no one can see them away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a big community of German football &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the Association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP executive director loses an eye in accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to wake up once you have fallen .

tweet Germany football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 Uhr / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , tu@@ ff will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Roman natur@@ alist Roman Br@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to use in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement by Mit@@ er R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , believes the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the wishes of the Federal Government , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also meet with industry representatives at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use it internationally to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; the Germans are still very skep@@ tical about the cars , much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra came to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , this could even imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , in a traffic jam of 45 percent . &quot;
good any fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current state , the D√ºsseldorf Congress wants to only hit singles with the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European Championship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l found herself at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term partnership in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ er List in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we have become European champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on that , &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth Apostle . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men into skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ mis@@ hed , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially rej@@ ection@@ able attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; the show is not built chron@@ ologically , but it is a super@@ bly chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ind the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially dedicated . &quot;
&quot; according to the Kur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot dated 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich . &quot;
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
earlier it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ er lace and was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects old styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not serve niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been om@@ itted . &quot;
private trade and wholesale business are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also seeks to score points in terms of environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have produced a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate student U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Druck@@ enst@@ elle of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and tips .
&quot; in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine rocks small spheres at some points . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took some inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ¬Æ young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surrounding areas and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as the modern am@@ bass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ¬Æ .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney is still wondering about a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ movie , but a kind of continuation , which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical ma@@ ids . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to expand the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal framework for the law and making the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to carry out their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect legitimate interests from foreign investments and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli attended the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury border value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish and to provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a job paper in the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ or fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already keeping the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on his home page , the Federal Environment Ministry explains in view of the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury gets to the environment especially through the burning of coal .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations report more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity of coal em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and widespread , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish had already become the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
