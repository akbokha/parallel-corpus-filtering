&quot; stated that the contract pursuant to Article IV paragraph 1 is not to be interpreted in such a way as to under@@ mine the in@@ expres@@ sible right of all contractual parties , while respecting equal treatment in accordance with Articles I and II of the Treaty to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes ; &quot;
&quot; stated that according to Article IV paragraph 2 of the contract , all contractual parties undertake to facilitate the wid@@ est possible exchange of equipment , material and scientific and technological information on the peaceful use of nuclear energy , and are entitled to participate ; &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the same paragraph of the same paragraph , the contracting parties who are able to work together with other states or international organisations to further develop the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , particularly in the territory of non @-@ nuclear weapons , are contributing to the development of the contracting party ; &quot;
&quot; in the order that Article III paragraph 4 stipul@@ ates that non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party , must be concluded either individually or together with other countries , according to the articles of the Articles of Association , in order to comply with the requirements of this article ; &quot;
&quot; in the recognition that the States have designated members of the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community ( Eur@@ atom ) in the following form as &quot; the Community , &quot; these organs will be able to operate independently on the areas that lie in their jurisdiction and which can immediately become effective within the juris@@ dic@@ tions of the Member States ; &quot;

B ) The organisation thus applies its safegu@@ ards to the provision of this agreement so that it can examine the provisions of the securing system of the Community by making sure that no core material has been bran@@ ched off from the peaceful use and used for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives .
the audit by the organization includes independent measurements and observations by the organisation according to the procedures laid down in this Convention .

&quot; a ) In the implementation of securing measures according to this Convention , technological developments in the field of securing measures are fully taken into account , and all efforts are made to ensure the optimum cost effectiveness and the application of the principle of an effective safety monitoring of the flow of core material which is subject to certain strategic points , as far as current or future technologies allow this . &quot;
&quot; B ) In order to ensure optimum cost effectiveness , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ern@@ isation as a means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; concentration of the verification procedures on the phases of the fuel cycle , concerning the manufacture , processing , use and storage of core material , from which could be produced without further core weapons and other core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) In accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organization in accordance with this Convention authori@@ zes the provision of information on nuclear material which is subject to safety measures , and on the characteristics of the installations that are relevant for the implementation of the safety measures relating to this material . &quot;

C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as small as possible ;
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials who have fulfilled the duties of the Convention on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated when the community and the organization establish that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that is no longer usable or practically non @-@ profit for a nuclear activity , which is from the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community notes the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ use of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the association with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures will be terminated upon this agreement with regard to this material , shall be used . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the non @-@ use of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision to ensure that the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are applied once again as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organisation is held on the basis of the total quantity and composition of the material in question and on any passing on such material from this state or these states on the ongoing basis .
&quot; this asser@@ ts its consent as soon as possible ; it applies only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or a non @-@ disclosure of the military activity , nor does it refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their authority , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se this cost as long as it has been clari@@ fied beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in the same manner as to the government and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention . &quot;
any claim that the Community or State has been asser@@ ted against the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against the community or a state because of damage - except for damages from a nuclear incident - shall be governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after scrut@@ iny of the relevant information provided by the Director General , the Council determines that the organization has not been able to verify that no nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures after this Convention , can then reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was achieved through the securing measures applied , provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state consult on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes resulting in an assessment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon the request of a party to submit to an arbit@@ ral tribunal consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named so named will elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator who pres@@ ides over . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the designation or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal &apos;s members are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , into force , i ) when the respective state of the organization is notified that its procedures for entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
a ) The organization and the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this agreement .
&quot; B ) All amendments require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall promptly inform all Member States of the organization by any amendment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention shall be determined as required in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I concerning securing measures .
the aim of the securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the distributing significant amounts of nuclear weapons for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with the spatial arrangement and monitoring as important complementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the material quantity demanded for a certain period is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified quantities . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their audit , the organization is making full use of the Community &apos;s security system after article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the Community will use de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined more closely in the supplementary agreements and are useful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock removed core material and the continu@@ ance quantities ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and the accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; ( C ) Meas@@ u@@ rement , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) procedures for evaluating accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and report system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes of this stock , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
&quot; B ) - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is in@@ stituted for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community believes that the recovery of core material which is not possible or desirable in Article 11 is not possible or desirable from residues , so the organisation and the community consult each other about the use of appropriate safegu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are am@@ ic@@ able that this core material is practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is retro@@ active , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the core material which would otherwise be subject to safety measures under this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards , if the total amount of nuclear material released in the states in the states is at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ aging material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; freed core material together with core material , which is subject to the protection measures under this agreement , should be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention , in detail as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any changes to the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization presents a summ@@ ar@@ ised inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this convention in the states , not@@ withstanding its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special agenda set up at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help address the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States will be bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ WG and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is inten@@ tional to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States are contributing to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; by the Organization ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is seper@@ ated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ applicable deb@@ tors of the Member State , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the state in order of the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the disposal site of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the residual value of the contribution to January 1 , 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned deadlines .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional distances to the cash or the notes of scho@@ oling to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and compensate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting this loan , the administrator can derive the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) of the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional lending capacity to terms of loan without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral submission ) , irrespective of whether it is considered to be a loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and managed for the purposes of the organization financed by the organisation , with the stated purpose of the agreement stated under the letter b ) . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions which apply to the organization &apos;s Lo@@ ans Lo@@ ans granted by the Organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 50 years each in ten years . &quot;
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
payments for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that maintains it .
each special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which in particular the origin of the funds is given .
&quot; the income from every transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced respectively ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who , according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan granted , may be recipients of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are eff@@ ected on the special transaction account , and in this way , in the currency of a member state , the amount paid will be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until full awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the review by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker instruc@@ ts the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ WG as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account .
&quot; after payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible sends a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the payments to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward until the complete issue of the means of a special transaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree , not into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all recei@@ v@@ ables accepted by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and returned to Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures involved .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications with a Noti@@ fication on the legitimate approval of this agreement by the EEC .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is to be closed in the form of a letter exchange to change the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issue the following statement : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; Euro@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are to be transferred to a joint enterprise according to Chapter IV of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is very familiar with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ apping and to speed up their respective research , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to take advantage of the possible benefits of the controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided by the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction faster . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Program@@ mes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or changed following examination by the organs referred to in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II will appear in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised through : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories operating on Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project as part of the objective of the present agreement .
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 , Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those established between the Commission and States and companies or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the date of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Business J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become contractual partners of any contract whose goal is to be concluded in the framework of this agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies appointed with the execution of the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of the present agreement shall be described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , includes the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to supervis@@ e the development of the research work and to direct the fact that the best possible results are achieved in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , this task is true in respect of all research and development activities that this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts their T * competence in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme and the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG has appointed one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking this . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups who submit to the VG research proposals with a view that the means granted to the Eur@@ atom programme are the best possible scientific results , with regard to all research and development work that is refer@@ enced in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors employed within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
&quot; the committee of directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for the fact that the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out in the programme , grant this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees implemented within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which dispose of the committee &apos;s committee for the best use of the means , the personnel as well as the knowledge and skills of laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task in the respective field with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country for the core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and the event@@ ual changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programmes and defining their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG for the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties are working on the work of all technical advisory panels or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is determined annually on an amount of the proportion of Eur@@ atom &apos;s GDP in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the common enterprise as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland presents an amount to the Common Business J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the Rules of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Business . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works within the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange , is calculated on the same basis which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to the financing of works , which are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission informs the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amounts to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the Commission the amount due to this Article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in App@@ endi@@ x III for the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures so that Eur@@ atom of duties or other donations , as well as import ban and restrictions , is exemp@@ t from the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; items purchased in Switzerland or acquired there may not be div@@ ested in any way or free of charge in this country , unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to wages and pensions that are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided for the association provided in Article 2 , Section 1 of the Agreement , shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resources . &quot;
the provisions relating to the access to the knowledge that apply to the participation of Switzerland at the joint company J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Charter of the Common Business .
the right of each contracting party for access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programmes according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be provided by Switzerland and the individuals or companies that justify access to these knowledge , under the same conditions as Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the affiliates or companies that operate in a member state of Eur@@ atom or an associate third country research or production activities , which justify access to these knowledge . &quot;
&quot; the contracting parties share this knowledge of other states , persons or companies only if an agreement is made between the parties , unless these individuals or companies operate research or production activities in Switzerland , which justify access to these knowledge . &quot;
&quot; if the knowledge referred to in section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the individuals or companies that are resident in the respective countries for research purposes in pursuit of the aims of this agreement . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government at the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close the stand@@ by loan agreements with the banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion Ac@@ counting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take up an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without it being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a loan opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the respective time , under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market sentences . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary means on the market itself , the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with the banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
I commend myself to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic about trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat from the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export options for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the actual annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed in accordance with the standard supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective cl@@ auses , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year . &quot;
the community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when new Member States are admitted , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount prescribed by the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this is taken into account under the Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 .
&quot; the total amount called &quot; &quot; total quantity &quot; &quot; is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meat in frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the basis of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the Design and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities specified in this agreement are issued for the products specified under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for issuing the import licence for the products .
&quot; furthermore , implementation regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informed the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and operates smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , the Lamb and the Go@@ al Market of the two parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions stipulated for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named after the Community . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties under the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount specified by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount , bearing the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that make them understandable for necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with you the approval of your government .
I would like to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions relating to the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep farming and export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat after the world market and especially after the community for New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that the normal sales of New Zealand lamb and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat access to the market of the Community in the height specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand preserves the assurance that the normal paragraph of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the actual quantity of the year does not exceed the set quantity . &quot;
the pre @-@ set amounts are carried out in the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the Community market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties will consult each other before introducing such a change in clause 10 above , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective cl@@ auses , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products captured by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the quantities stipulated in clause 2 according to the volume of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import burdens for these new Member States shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this is taken into account in clause 5 of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 .
the total amount stated in clause 2 will be set up with the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes to avoid market development which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meat in frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the regulation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ haus@@ sch in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular by no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority named by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for issuing the import licence for the products .
&quot; furthermore , implementation regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent New Zealand authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informed the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and operates smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions stipulated for the purpose stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not imp@@ acted by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named after the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the amount specified in clause 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of the annual amount of this agreement , which dates from the entry into force of this agreement , is determined in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement takes effect on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be checked by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I would like to suggest that , if your government can agree to the above , this letter and your response will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I encourage myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions relating to the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance given on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum coag@@ ulation in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated solely in volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are established at present . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions during ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation . &quot;
the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the restoration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard of standards in international units ( see Bulletin Board WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the government supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the pre@@ conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group identification should not be d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement reached a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent in a vessel is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount being stored in a container must be so large that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for the evaluation of blood group identification .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents spend as long as possible from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each container is a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the fluid required for re @-@ dissolution , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 3. the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the fluid required for re @-@ dissolution , &quot;
each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention pursuant to the Con@@ tract for this Protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of group B which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B . there are no human red blood cells containing no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding equivalent to ti@@ tr@@ ate separately against floods of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the serum can in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination is to occur during any in@@ undation within the double time , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of selected people of group A which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific group B substances .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ision against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5 to 10 % F@@ loo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within twice the time required if the same attempt is performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is derived from the blood of selected persons in group 0 which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ inus C@@ lay A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB , i.e. those of group 0 . &quot;
it is ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which in general are not ag@@ glut@@ inated by anti @-@ A serum for group B blood don@@ ors ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding equivalent , separately to ti@@ tr@@ ate against in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or corresponding compar@@ ision against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the serum can in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum has also to provoke an easily recognis@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same trials are performed with the non @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10 % F@@ loo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two species , which differ by the conditions in which ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells are reached . &quot;
&quot; with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are washed up in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be subject to change if International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum can react with blood cells containing do an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are determined to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with in@@ undation of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; the title of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 against c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and should not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and must not contain anti @-@ D in any form ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E serum .

&quot; if a serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; there are no human red blood cells containing no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur during any in@@ undation within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the B blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the non @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding equivalent , with an in@@ undation of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of B @-@ blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within twice the time required if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group psychology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ecting human serum proteins .

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fication of the limits and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the recognition that the community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the action programme , as of 1 January 1988 , a uniform administration paper must be introduced within the Community trade . &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a single administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in the opinion that this agreement may not be interpreted in any way , that it dis@@ integrates the contracting parties from their obligations from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are laid to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single @-@ duty paper ) is introduced , which is to be used in particular for all export and import procedures as well as for a shared shipping method ( herein@@ after called shipping method ) in the goods transport between the contracting parties . &quot;
&quot; the ram@@ bl@@ ings associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are fulfilled by means of a single paper , for which pre @-@ print@@ ings are to be used according to the samples in An@@ nex I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper is used as a registration or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot;
- in order to carry out legal requirements applicable in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single item ;
it is demanded by the participants so that they can come on request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief .
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties , simplified procedures , even in the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied proceedings may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not required at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must be made subsequently , in which the competent authorities can act as a periodi@@ c collective request , within the deadline set out by these authorities . &quot;
in cases of paragraph 1 may be allowed instead of the single paper trading paper .
&quot; if the single paper is used , the parties with the consent of the competent authorities will be able to join all the duties involved with the export and import duties , instead of the supplementary sheets of the single paper in the trade common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;

&quot; - allow the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the relevant data into their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , if necessary without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; to allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , that the import , dispatch or import registration is carried out either by the entry paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing system ; &quot;
- Assistance to apply those adopted by the Council in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions relating to the provision of conditions required for the export , shipping and import of goods required by the single document are laid down in An@@ nex II to this Convention . &quot;

( 1 ) The registration shall be carried out in one of the official languages of the contracting parties which are authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the form@@ alities for export or shipping shall be fulfilled .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or country of country of the applicant or its representative in this country may request a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The registration shall always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country , if in this country they are issued by the customs office of the export or departure country of the registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration copies required for each individual process of a transaction between the contracting parties , where applicable , if necessary the copies required to assist in any of the following sections may be included . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collection shipments , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for export and shipping procedures can be reduced to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities shall agree to the extent possible that the information contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings shall agree . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth transaction between the contracting parties and to facilitate the coverage of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request , or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or rejected , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the respective decision and grounds for the asylum seek@@ er must be notified immediately . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which could not afford it , if it is requested , it points out in its request to this circum@@ stance . &quot;
( 5 ) The information received pursuant to paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and shall enjoy the protection granted by the national law of the country which it has received .
&quot; this information may only be used with the written consent of the customs authority , which it has issued , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority in any other way . &quot;

&quot; each contracting party is taking appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , with the need to be taken into account as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions to the difficulties arising from goods traffic as far as possible and with the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall apply to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for the regions of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Convention is also applicable to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs treaty .

&quot; in the decision that the development of technology and the structures of international trade requires significant changes to the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 on the customs tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of goods into tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE WOR@@ LD that the level of differentiation required by the governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is far beyond what is contained in the system for the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in the recognition that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing process , the harmon@@ ised system for the freight tari@@ ffs and traffic statistics of the various modes of transport should be used , &quot;

the parties of the agreement signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950 on the establishment of a Council for the cooperation in the field of customs duty
&quot; it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of goods entered into force on June 14 , 1983 in Brussels on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the opinion that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned convention , the date of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in article 13 of the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of goods , which was concluded in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 is given : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January , which after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of at least three months is immediately followed , at which at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ ons designated in Article 11 have signed the agreement or deposited their rati@@ fication or accession papers , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
A. This protocol also enters into force with the Convention if at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic Uni@@ ons designated in Article 11 of the Convention have deposited their documents on the adoption of the protocol at the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council for the cooperation in the field of customs .
&quot; however , only States or customs or economic Uni@@ ons can deposit the document on the adoption of this Protocol , which have previously signed the agreement without reservation of rati@@ fication or signed it at the same time or which have deposited its document on rati@@ fication or by joining the Convention , or at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B. E@@ ach state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this protocol according to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; it is a plant which is indispensable not only for the maintenance and preservation of soils , but also allows the extraction of land which does not allow any other planting , which re@@ acts to any improvement in cultivation methods , even with extensive crops , which constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production . &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that its cultivation depends on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn are completely dependent on the measures required to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table oli@@ ven are essential ingredients in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the in@@ convenience of harvesting and market supply , and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer revenues ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , this causes all particular difficulties which can seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in countries that are in zones where the cultivation of olive trees is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary importance of olive oil production for the economy of numerous countries , especially of the development of olive cultiv@@ ars in the development of olive oil ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , given the particular conditions of olive growing and the market for olive products , necessary measures go beyond national boundaries and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the 1956 International olive oil convention in its version amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958 , as well as the International Bi@@ ological Convention of 1963 in its amended amended version and the International Bi@@ ological Convention of 1979 ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ CO@@ D that it is essential to continue and develop the work that was begun within the framework of the aforementioned conventions , and that it is desirable to close a new agreement - &quot;
the aims of the 1986 International Convention on olive oil and table oli@@ ven ( in the following )
&quot; in consideration of the provisions of the Resol@@ utions 93 ( IV ) , 124 ( V ) and 155 ( VI ) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the following are : &quot;
&quot; B ) maintain appropriate working conditions in olive growing and in the olive industry , in order to raise the standard of living of populations ; &quot;
&quot; to co @-@ ordin@@ ate the production , industri@@ alisation and marketing policy for olive oil , olive oil and table oli@@ ven and the organisation of the market for these products ; &quot;
D ) investigate and facilitate the use of the necessary measures with respect to the other products of the olive tree ;
&quot; III ) reduce the production costs of the products thereof , especially the olive oil , in order to improve the position of this oil on the overall market for fluid vegetable oils , &quot;
&quot; ( IV ) Im@@ proving the position of the olive industry in relation to the environment in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Environment of Man , to resolve any har@@ ass@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; ( a ) facilitate the investigation and use of measures to increase international trade with olive products , in order to increase the means which the producers of produce , especially those in the development , can achieve , increase and accelerate their economic growth and social development taking into account the interests of consumers ; &quot;
B ) to meet all the measures that are appropriate to extend the consumption of olive oil and tab@@ le@@ ware ;
&quot; C ) to prevent any practice of unfair competition in international trade with olive oil , olive oil and tab@@ le@@ ware , and to combat the delivery of goods if necessary &quot;
&quot; D ) improve market access and reliability of supply , market structures and marketing , distribution and promotion systems ; &quot;
( e ) undertake all activities and measures that are suitable to exhibit the biological value of the olive oil and the table oli@@ ven ;
&quot; ( B ) facilitate the investigation and application of measures to harmon@@ ize the legal provisions of the individual states , which refer in particular to the marketing of olive oil and tab@@ le@@ ware ; &quot;
&quot; II ) to prevent excessive fluctuations in prices that must remain on such a stand that they are profitable and fair for producers , and are appropriate for the consumer ; &quot;
