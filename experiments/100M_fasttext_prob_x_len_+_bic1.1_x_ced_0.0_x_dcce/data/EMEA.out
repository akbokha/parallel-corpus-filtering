this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. disc@@ ard thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; for both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or the melting tablets in patients that cause difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients taking other medicines simultaneously , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts mainly as &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree , acts as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters in order to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three trials over up to one year . &quot;
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ surgery , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb them .
&quot; in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of efficacy in treating man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled bleeding ) , nausea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the distribution of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and related their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness of doses over a 15 mg daily dose was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if the signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sent@@ an@@ esth@@ esia are treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study containing a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with aria treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg aria per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ chat@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the lack of data on the safety of humans and due to the concerns that arise in the animal studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from semi @-@ surgery . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term efficacy phase , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a potentially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks on healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on put@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , in comparison to placebo , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly stronger improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in one half @-@ operation @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medi@@ ate were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % and semi @-@ surgery ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in semi @-@ surgery . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher rate of decline that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo versus placebo in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; also in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole indicated a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean age of Eli@@ min@@ ation is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study show schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on its metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , toxic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they only have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ kles tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ rin@@ ds carcin@@ oma ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile duc@@ ts , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a potentially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a positive response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can , alternatively , take tabl@@ enam@@ el tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after onset or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a potentially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) lay . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under b@@ ypass of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acne therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ast@@ ar@@ iness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the aria treatment solution , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was larger compared to the in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly applied dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) as one @-@ off in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , while the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ations was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term efficacy phase , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with aria patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and Beh@@ avi@@ oral Dis@@ orders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ast@@ ar@@ iness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement seen from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed with respect to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in one half @-@ operation @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medi@@ ate were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ surgery ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current measurement scales , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi @-@ surgery . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rate of decline in 34 % in the aria ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole indicated a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application during a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times over the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to IV application , no safety @-@ related concerns occurred after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , toxic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ kles tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ adren@@ al carcin@@ oma ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosage , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of whom about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
only those patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer were not able to distinguish between the efficacy @-@ indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel medications , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued an approval for Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
&quot; sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 should stop the treatment until an improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ articles formulation from pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel alone . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
&quot; while an un@@ equi@@ vocal cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tious methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should use abrasion during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child to testify . &quot;
&quot; prior to the treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm preser@@ v@@ ative , because through the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility exists . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
&quot; listed below are the most common and most important cases of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most noticeable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; pain in the abdom@@ en , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , neck pain , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules compound which promotes the pooling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ular indi@@ um and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for vital inter @-@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sist@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ in@@ ep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for m@@ amma cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mono therapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel in 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who underwent a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel in 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
&quot; active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) has increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or crossover linking of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the pac@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is mainly met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients over 75 years of age , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic drug , as well as other potential toxic substances should be handled with care when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
using a sterile sy@@ ringe is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle .
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot;
&quot; then the pier@@ cing bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete res@@ us@@ sion@@ ing of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if cut@@ ters or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must again be gently inver@@ ted in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before application . &quot;

&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the pier@@ cing bottle up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) when it is stored in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
each capsule contains 100 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the re@@ constitution each ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ um@@ solution from humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application of pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic drug .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch supplies the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . • With a clear picture presentation of the correct use of the product , provided cooling boxes for transport by the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood blood values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood flow is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected before the procedure . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ections can also be performed by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which makes it suitable for the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; when administered as an injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems related an@@ emia , with reference to the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before being converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the onset of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed among the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were treated to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , constant mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; bot@@ t@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;

&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy , where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( such as cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in planned larger surgical procedures that require a large flow of blood ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , where high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage can be reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 3.6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose of 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose that is necessary for controlling an@@ emia .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ rence of &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction coefficient of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence of &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence of &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed foods is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
the iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the treatment .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients who suffer from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia or PR@@ CA ) should not receive a stre@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are eligible for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program is the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or basic disease , vascular disease of the cardi@@ oid or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ cu@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ ating , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms and preventing blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in intake should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for the evaluation of therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients that may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 ) to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 ) treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient who should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is not possible to exclude that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can pers@@ ist for patients with an initial out@@ feed value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had been returned if a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red .
&quot; used in conjunction with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies of tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ otic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ or may cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lic@@ ated and identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ tigen patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ as ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 lung cancer tum@@ ors , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster . &quot;
survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate compared to the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and for controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated IV administration showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last administration . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies involving nearly the 20@@ x of the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat body weight , a delay in the dose of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in red@@ dish mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed uniquely for a maximum period of 3 days outside the refriger@@ ant and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gra@@ ding rings and the filling volume is indicated by an adhesive label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ corpor@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ o- to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will cancel your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , bot@@ t@@ amed has to be given through injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or ascending levels of potassium , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , the treatment of blood wor@@ m@@ wood with ab@@ sc@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ e values ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your chosen dose accordingly in order to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully before the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) , or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ osis ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative influence on the tumour under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ minent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , since there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines or used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( medium to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may , if necessary , arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the results and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are well set , regular doses of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg receive regular doses of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the results and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin . &quot;

&quot; eye li@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ ino@@ id e@@ dem@@ a ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come to a blood @-@ drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used in 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture such as the disease ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis participated , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years which have recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of cycl@@ oram@@ as was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo . &quot;
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis patients ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a manufactures re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the placing of Ac@@ last@@ a in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The supplementary indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ duction of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy eating • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol , can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended for patients with limited clinical experience . &quot;
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate to a dental laboratory with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients receiving dental gri@@ ps , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms caused by acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
ren@@ al dysfunction z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recently collap@@ sed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area became known , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures . &quot;
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw@@ s area in a patient with acet@@ one and treated with placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a dispens@@ ing of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) using either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Sc@@ ore for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ last@@ a treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a similar effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips and the dist@@ al radius was significantly compared with placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of the lum@@ bar density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , of the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the basin one year after the third annual dose . &quot;
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ecular bones and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bones compared to placebo .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mort@@ gage was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment in comparison with placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at the overall th@@ igh and fem@@ oral neck at all times .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , especially light to moderate morph@@ ine Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was proven in two six months of comparative studies .
&quot; in the case of combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response from 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma cruci@@ ble quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ ic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination round time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of distribution ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface underneath the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
&quot; reduced clearance of metabol@@ ised substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because they are not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because of severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in trials with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of humane @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced due to low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time according to preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;

risk management plan The holder of approval for the placing on the market under@@ takes to conduct studies and additional activities related to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance that are outlined in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human drug products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known , which could affect the current information on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ last@@ a works by re @-@ norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , giving the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you take drugs from which it is known that they damage the kidneys .
&quot; when applying Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient amounts of fluid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; prior to the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , if you are considering ending treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after having received Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this user information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C and 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ comp@@ lia is applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparison to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia can be found . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can ampli@@ fy the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable at the same time using A@@ comp@@ lia with medication such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in relation to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing treatment packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
he has added a diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) who additionally have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive symptoms of depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases prev@@ ails the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have percep@@ tible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other nearby persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms , and immediately seek medical advice when these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .
&quot; ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied , is assumed that the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; patients with obesity have been examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse events that occurred under treatment in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher when the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a tolerance study where a limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , relative to the initial value compared to 1,6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in overall weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Wei@@ ght reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was seen an average decrease in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % ( starting value tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo I
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; after 13 days , the Ste@@ ady State plasma cruci@@ ble was achieved ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ CI = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;

patients with black skin colour may have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C compared to other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ational @-@ mac@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old male .
&quot; 5.3 Pres@@ sure data for the safety of the following unwanted effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human@@ oid area , were considered to be potentially relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , allowing a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
• Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be maintained except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar levels are sin@@ king , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in triple therapy was studied in more than 1 400 patients ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic substance ; in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos leads to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced in the use of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo was reduced by 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos additionally showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ vascular ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that , as an alternative to standard treatment , Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is not suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular illness was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values will be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that refer to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is continued should be guided by the clinical evaluation to the pre@@ condition of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed for comparing controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ant or as dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported to be impaired by di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular o@@ e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs , treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not ex@@ ert any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors cannot be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the resulting hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine are dimin@@ ished and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across three times the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular diseases the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial covering a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation ) receptor @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose metabolism in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was observed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ly adjusted with insulin had been random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while values decreased under metabol@@ ites and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previous advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized to receive either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies proved that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was mainly found in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination round time of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ance resem@@ ble the mother &apos;s substance . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the resulting hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine are dimin@@ ished and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans resulted in increased frequency of col@@ o@@ don@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or ci@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial higher tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the objective with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medications , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to the other human insulin analog . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package contents ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly through an intensified insulin therapy can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warnings and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the change . &quot;
some patients who appeared hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which goes over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor therefore must take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 Also hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy An rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally rever@@ sible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar levels can however be associated with a temporary decrease in di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
skin diseases and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Occ@@ a@@ sional - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise if neglected to change the cre@@ ep points within the injection area .
&quot; general disorders and complaints at the place of performance Occ@@ a@@ sional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; disorders of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ thema Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , breathing difficulty , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; di@@ abe@@ tics therefore should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of operation is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or ret@@ ar@@ ded resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle is taken out of the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is used in accordance with the manual for the first use .
some patients who appeared hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
the doctor therefore must take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tu@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be absorbed , then the amount of the long acting insulin . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of crystall@@ isation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out k@@ not ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger amounts of urine , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , sei@@ zur@@ es can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic or aden@@ ur@@ ic treat patients at least during the first six months . &quot;
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 m@@ g. a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay in the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took 80 mg once daily in a dose of once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg , during the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo was the case . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , nausea , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with cardiac problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also cause a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including a poison node known from the medical history and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum pole volume is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease With patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ inous medications , it can come to an acute g@@ out attack during the course of treatment because by lowering the serum pole @-@ acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the fa@@ xing treatment and in the further course of the liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was no interaction studies to F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at performed , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a blocking of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in fa@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;

&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ s down the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be linked to the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experiments cannot be directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or when performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be determined . &quot;
the risk factors observed in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long@@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin lesi@@ ons , skin lesi@@ ons , skin lesi@@ ons , decrease of the potassium concentration in the blood , decrease of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction chamber Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → x@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
&quot; clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly average levels of serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.5 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.5 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the lowering of serum pole diameter to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
&quot; 50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum carot@@ ene values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with function of ren@@ al function The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum har@@ n@@ ac@@ c concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ ac@@ re@@ concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ aci@@ dity concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a feed rate in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a feed supply ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in pla@@ iting no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the peak grades up to 24 months . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long@@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking easier or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentration was observed provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after ing@@ es@@ tion of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma volume of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the total dose was found in the chair as an unchanged f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transitional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 @-@ times the exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and ur@@ inary composition and are considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4 @-@ fold of the human@@ oid exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which went along with a lowering of the up@@ stream performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions that approximately 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; the holder of permission for the transport has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation and is available as long as the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented at risk management systems for human drug products with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available that have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you hold the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way a reduction of discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be used if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the substance F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this drug if you have or had a heart defect or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you are treated for a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital condition in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before you start treating with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be in any case , but could also occur with you , especially during the first week of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines or used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking drugs using any of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your physician might consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart diseases )
there have been no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; therefore , please use AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from in@@ compatibility with certain sugar@@ s . &quot;
the single week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster pack so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data , which indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , abor@@ ted abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour clas@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used for diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission approved Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve the distribution of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising up the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; e.g. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract besides p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms which point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be informed when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular heart@@ burn or new or deterior@@ ating heart@@ burn may reduce the drug and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it following symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose list of therap@@ ists predominantly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available that give clu@@ es whether the onset of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the planning of therapy in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE they should take the tablet next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , levels of serum calcium were up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats to ≤ 2.5 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups of similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sight of an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ids to vitamin D3 .

the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ k@@ tur intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spine after 3 years , 5.@@ 9 % in the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the desc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy fraction by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected by one year ( for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a restart of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ance is absorbed in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of formulation or regime should only be performed under close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ance should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot;
&quot; after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both vene@@ er and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the dosage can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral treatment in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be started intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression needs to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be expressed . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral adv@@ ection therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance If a gra@@ ft recipient of two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules must be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , this change@@ over has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ance once a day the treatment with the or@@ ally recommended oral initial dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection is commen@@ ced once a day .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients , who are converted to Adv@@ ance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with lawyers , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , came to an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day , transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and with transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular identification of the serum carot@@ ene levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ance When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror controls .
frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels should also be controlled after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as precau@@ tion is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious un@@ desirable events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of formulation or regime should only be performed under close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 for the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance . &quot;
no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood .
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during a treatment with the agent should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea are particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable variations .
&quot; in rare cases , aqu@@ eous humor , called cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid excess and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as precau@@ tion contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , are special caution . &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels at the same time , which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ yel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by inhibit@@ ing the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ances of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
animal testing has shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the supplementary performance profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be found precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
&quot; subsequent , the side effects are reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ance .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cells .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes . &quot;
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or lack of follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the grade group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ance C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ance vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ ance Arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) occurred deaths . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily applied Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations , Pro@@ gra@@ f , has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f correspon@@ ded to these published studies in the large trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung Transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , 2@@ 1,7 % of cases occurred in the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute corneal gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3,@@ 3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target levels of between 8 and 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tations showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to levels of gra@@ ft rejection ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the higher clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs across the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ance ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers them to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , adv@@ ate efficacy in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic periods has been awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , m@@ aus@@ e- or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of Adv@@ ates in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma level ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period . &quot;
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , an appropriate determination of the VI@@ II @-@ plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 Proph@@ yla@@ xis Dur@@ ing long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration depends on the patient &apos;s desire , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 m@@ L / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II against Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product was observed in another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients with a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;

&quot; in previously untreated patients undergoing a current clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited published the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that bin@@ ds , supports and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in should have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the field of sub@@ structure , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he was asking , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
based on the review of the submitted documents the CH@@ MP prepares a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will benefit patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all hay fever symptoms , except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who alone took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who alone benefited . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of a@@ ero ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart@@ burn ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the transportation of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been finished .
it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this can be attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ ci@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ ci@@ amin , dop@@ ed@@ rine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient collective and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations on dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations on dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze can be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients treated with or@@ adi@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired ability to transport or to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible lateral procedures . &quot;

&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective lack of drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic background . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ tic application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the equilibrium balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine organic equivalent was the exposure after giving an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;

&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving 4 800 adults and adolescents suffering from allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials for seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two trials of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children harmless . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were observed when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline of symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current illness and may be terminated following the end of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during their recur@@ rence .
the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy process .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in an impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered for over 14 days a daily dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval became apparent . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective lack of drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms , and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all primitive diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also responsible for the improvement of the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) were not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hypo@@ cris@@ p , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the disease . &quot;
&quot; for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is limited and experienced a higher amount of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase is@@ om@@ is@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval became apparent . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; at a single @-@ dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect the psych@@ omot@@ or function . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol induced loss of alcohol induced by the simultaneous intake of alcohol has resulted in an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this limiting metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup@@ tly formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are being met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ w bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; take a dose of Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ ophi@@ le dose must be taken from the intake without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was used for up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for over 14 days a daily dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective lack of drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray must be taken without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to the removable formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for over 14 days a daily dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective lack of drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ised phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population . &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el tablets proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to the removable formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily for over 14 days a daily dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective lack of drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of enam@@ el coated tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were organic equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical trials for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase is@@ om@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population were comparable . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may , depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limiting metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; because A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution to intake the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , there was no biological equi@@ valence study needed and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially told the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products at A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against the flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to man , because human beings have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; following the vaccine , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is subsequently able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was dis@@ connected , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine using the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface ) . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ in should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ather@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
&quot; when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not to cure , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infection related to AIDS and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was reinforced with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , previously occupied with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are also broken down as ather@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gen@@ ase risk of cereb@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks .
&quot; gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of ag@@ ro@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was submitted at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company to appro@@ ve the market launch of A@@ gener@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ ro@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycle 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r during the consumption of am@@ per@@ tur@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal clinical course .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; for patients taking these medicines at the same time , ather@@ ase can be less effective because of the reduced plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if there are also low doses given by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ds of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be treated with care in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which medicines were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are present . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycle 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly mixed with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma level with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ per@@ tur@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment diagram . &quot;
&quot; 52 % is degra@@ ded when amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ gi@@ cides component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , no dose adaptation is required ( 100 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce serum concentration of ammon@@ ium avi@@ r .
&quot; should these drugs be used simultaneously , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus a rise in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma level of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily with no simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other drugs that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may , if used together with ather@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines when used in combination with ather@@ ase .
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a because it can cause resor@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degradation of the plasma cruci@@ fixi@@ on of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with ather@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of am@@ per@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increases in the plasma level at the same time . &quot;
&quot; because plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabil@@ isation of the mirror is recommended , since plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased simultaneously ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 fa@@ k .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at present , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after thorough weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether pren@@ atal avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ lac@@ tation phase , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of ammon@@ ium avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , and rose early and rarely led to the onset of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated persons treated with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( breast@@ stroke ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were treated in 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or spot@@ less nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and incidence of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common among patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on the signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ sth@@ eses with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the 13 of 14 children , in which vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 4@@ 1@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otype interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with increased probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for assessment of the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear to provoke . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a large number of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis determines the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ dec@@ im@@ al threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased a@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gro@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % on the other hand , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a substrate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be treated with care if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
this treatment regi@@ mens lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained at healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily with no simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - x ( rats ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present study data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes contained , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ather@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after thorough weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ lac@@ tation phase , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on the signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account with PI pre@@ treated children under the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a substrate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be treated with care if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present study data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al abl@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabol@@ isation routes are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ cavi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase is used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children over the age of 4 . &quot;
the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account was neither documented with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dose p@@ inion , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adaptation for am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ e patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ds , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to inhal@@ e infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with impaired liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are present . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with ather@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected ; however , it is not known whether pren@@ atal avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast @-@ lac@@ tation phase , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described above were rarely observed . &quot;
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a large number of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on these data should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children under the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be absorbed into the tissues due to a large ne@@ sting volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; • The treatment frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied for five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo had to be treated either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ bet@@ rot@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limiting the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream can continue until all visible til@@ ting war@@ ts in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the treated lesi@@ ons are not completely healed during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream can be applied in a thin layer and ri@@ pped in the puri@@ fied skin area , until the cream is completely coated . &quot;
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease should take place in these patients .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host response should take place in these patients .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ ture leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed in rare cases that require treatment and / or have led to temporary physical injury .
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ators for the treatment of external incl@@ ine in the genital and peri@@ anal region has not yet been studied .
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lesser efficacy in this patient group concerning the elimination of til@@ ting war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during the therapy or the reactions develop after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made for several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the application for already treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ic areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ose on arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normal@@ y decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 acne lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be achieved either after a unique or repeated , topical application , no recommendations can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most common and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related adverse events in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of til@@ ting ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include discomfort at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
reported side effects reported in 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side @-@ effects .
the most common adverse effects associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related adverse effects were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream treated with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ foli@@ ation ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ or@@ age and shor@@ tening ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials for the study of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; accidental one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the stu@@ ds in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; in 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , patients healed completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
&quot; the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed , individual primary , super@@ fici@@ ally quanti@@ fiable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - lesi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical cure after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications external genital war@@ ts , acute ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the doses investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ we@@ eded in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life expect@@ ancy was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to a significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight in a four @-@ month study for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months yiel@@ ded no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the mal@@ er administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not vag@@ ue , a risk for the human being is considered very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors entered the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under 5 years of age are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to appro@@ ve the inclusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any related side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase III study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ca ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time using chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
&quot; side effects in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are common in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
most patients showed a serum version within 3 months after the treatment was started ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early withdrawal from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in which it had never come to serum version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was to be determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ al@@ ising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the treatment of enzymes is the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium , and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity . &quot;
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of lung function and hearing ability shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ at@@ aly@@ sis before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first four weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established that remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes encomp@@ assing five efficacy end@@ points ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe lead form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development velocity , whereas in the older patients with severe lead form , only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

&quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che • joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it can no longer be stored for 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of diar@@ rhe@@ a bottles to be dil@@ uted .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be decreased . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the compar@@ ational medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve the market launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for large plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for large plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after the completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given the day before and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third action lif@@ ecycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place considering the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of prev@@ ent@@ ative treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reductions an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over there is an increased risk of secondary effects in patients aged 65 years or over .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dosage adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper boundary value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase levels of &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ mal@@ ady and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p number has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were observed when pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for whom therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ u@@ ity should be weigh@@ ed before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , when this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment centre to obtain advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ ular preservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed secre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses should be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b is available , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no dates for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , unless it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; given the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm preser@@ v@@ ative . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; side effects frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( less than 1 / 10.000 ) and not known ( based on available data from spontaneous reports ) . &quot;
&quot; * * * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for each toxic@@ ity degree , excluded the event &quot; Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &quot; * * which was derived from the term &quot; kidneys / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , taste distur@@ b@@ ance and hair loss are reported only as Grade 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established with regard to the recording of all events where the reporting doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and mot@@ oric neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 26@@ 5 patients , random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as mon@@ otherapy with gifts of foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 and 27@@ 6 patients who random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ axel as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
* * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for any toxic@@ ity degree * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) hair loss is reported only as Grade 1 or 2 .
&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established with regard to the recording of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for possible . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three single p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as pha@@ k@@ sis 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for the recording of all events where the reporting doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ini@@ zed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ ts and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients that were be@@ amed before or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important , fol@@ ly @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies show that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attacking points by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ l@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ am@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ in@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin at chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the study medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural retina was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the common c@@ is@@ pla@@ yo@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and in@@ timi@@ dation of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was found in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0,@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4,@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
CI = CI = Y @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally signi@@ fier for non @-@ inferior ; with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ limit limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as a mono @-@ otherapeu@@ tic were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ sions over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly found in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours of use .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total resolution of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection for 9 months ( De@@ genetics and nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
&quot; if not applied in addition , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; solve the content of 100 mg perme@@ ability bottles with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
&quot; 23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;

it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie low fat diet .
patients who are taking All@@ i and receiving no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats added with the food in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently to the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg , reported an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no more relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stud , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ duct of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant and nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the marketing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ y , fat @-@ induced nutrition . &quot;
children and adolescents under 18 should not be used all@@ i because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed only minim@@ ally , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic may need to be adapted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent potential failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a decrease of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma has been observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international regular ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ enes have remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of reported side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring .
&quot; in most of the cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ passive properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ent binding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials for adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
with the waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeutic doses of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) could be detected with no signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified with approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ mas concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , is described and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

the most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules and are caused by the fact that fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as at this time , you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related symptoms : • Beg@@ in some days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood is that you exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as information on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum of one day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; whatever amount is appropriate for you , take out the information below that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by respecting the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0,5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. 3 km of walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional diary containing information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat ads and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are due to nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by supple@@ menting Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
patients under 18 years of age are not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate to nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then the colon clean@@ se , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , Alo@@ xi is not used in the days after chemotherapy , neither for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity in the five studied chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration oral meth@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; no dose @-@ active relationships could be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large volume of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for al@@ op@@ xi@@ de over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of cy@@ c@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy of ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 . &quot;
results from studies of moderate chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption Accor@@ ding to IV administration a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations is followed by a gradual elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ of / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous dosage of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a unique intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time indication of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal &apos;s terminal life time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human@@ oid exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Pre @-@ clinical studies have indicated that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the failure to appro@@ ve the treatment of the drug envis@@ aged for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage damages and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further enhanced in the blood norm . &quot;
&quot; a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) is produced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturer submitted data that vali@@ date the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , efficacy , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , measured how many patients responded to 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment of the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C responding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ar@@ ded in more patients than in the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection related to cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ate Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both trials were taken together in house hours , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( freezing cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common adverse effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the placing place .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go have out@@ weigh@@ ed the following superficial skin infections over the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. approval for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully removed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on a sc@@ rap@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to be weigh@@ ed between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery that concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of retin@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the transfer of pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transm@@ it@@ ters , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50 @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of the resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be taken into consideration . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity at rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ oma test resp@@ . in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither in male nor female rats signs of impaired fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sc@@ rap@@ ed skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ onic study of rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , development sto@@ x@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a refreshing dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can defend itself against illness . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vacc@@ ination approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix introduced one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for the pri@@ mer di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refreshing vacc@@ ination is desired for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection stimul@@ ants , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction following the administration of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system , insufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels are achieved , so that in these cases the administration of additional vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ arter@@ ial injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation disturbances , however , ambient matrix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception as it may result in bleeding after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ ps ro@@ ach vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , there must be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed following the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % compared to a dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matches was comparable to each sample ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were given Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination diagram with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ational stimul@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
&quot; the immun@@ ore@@ activity observed in this study was comparable to the immun@@ ore@@ activity followed by a combination vaccine after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units of formula A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination schedule .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the incub@@ ation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after resor@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state Char@@ gen Act is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus prior to the administration of both doses of vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child feels uncomfortable or sick at the vacc@@ ination time ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. If you / your child has a severe infection with a fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system or if you / your child undergo hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / she / she / she / she will receive further medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) , or if you have recently been vacc@@ inated , or have been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambition is not given to pregnant or nursing women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP surv@@ eyed the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , because Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient expos@@ ures . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ y can also be used in pre@@ history for patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is administered - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ pod ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ k could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ tane may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste sa@@ version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ k was approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease there was only limited information on this drug at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of living ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow pills or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulated form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient necessary for growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
ar@@ gin@@ ine patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate are carried out over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ on loss . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ ac@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which at intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram @-@ bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ecting , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen free an@@ alogues in the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative routes of nitrogen removal ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life months ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ kam tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , were 98 % survival rate . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after giving a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected in plasma the next morning after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma cruci@@ ble in the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
secre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow pills , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ i@@ che or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ pipes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) before the birth , it occurred to lesi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ ac@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it may be assumed that for each gram @-@ bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulated form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to obtain the drug via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , neglect of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you are experiencing one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a suitable treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the taking of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , dimin@@ ished appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .
you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container in accordance with &quot; User until &quot; stated exp@@ iry date .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly over same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the stomach directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take a tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the outer edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( abnormal measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the primary study of the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ ox related to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ de@@ dine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the placing of angi@@ ox in the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ ho@@ stage inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is not diagnosed with a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a dose of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intake of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intru@@ sion is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second casting of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce suscep@@ ti@@ bility to lower ACT values , re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the dose dose can be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al function ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT @-@ value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients Angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• serious hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other constitu@@ ent or against hi@@ de@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even though most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur under bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in principle bleeding may occur everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again reaching the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ it@@ ators ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ase parameters must be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in treated women , as well as in patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred alone significantly less frequently in the group with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reducing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in treated women , as well as in patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately to be canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patient was diagnosed with a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ market attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( prior to angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple outcomes of a random@@ ized double blind trial with more than 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 . &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients delivered limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
&quot; it is expected that as a pe@@ p@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is able to pass a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool . &quot;
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
the elimination is achieved in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals during repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 @-@ times of the clinical Ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was restricted to super@@ imposed pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; side effects caused by long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ hom@@ ec@@ ost@@ atic coag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to those in clinical use , even with a much higher dosage . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body cannot produce enough insulin to control glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin analog .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin analog . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glucose level .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in the area of abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of abdominal bags . &quot;
&quot; because of the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc deficiency , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can undergo a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active agent of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment of the treatment diagram .
&quot; substances which can increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c acids like beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reservation may be weakened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is transi@@ tioning into human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;

&quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ ines the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in the normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin gran@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin analog and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ide effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin analog .
&quot; the data shows that a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin @-@ ul@@ cer@@ ation was applied 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin @-@ ul@@ cer@@ ation is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ dd@@ les before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in by giving 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before starting the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1 ) , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin dose in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal @-@ insulin analog insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
