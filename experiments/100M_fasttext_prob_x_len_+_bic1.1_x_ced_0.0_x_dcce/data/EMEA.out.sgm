<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. discard thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"for both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or the melting tablets in patients that cause difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients taking other medicines simultaneously, the same as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably acts mainly as "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree, acts as the neurotransmitters in order to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazzol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, to prevent the recurrence of symptoms, was studied in three trials over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-surgery, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb them.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of efficacy in treating manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled bleeding), nausea (drowsiness), nausea, drowsiness (drowsiness), nausea, drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the distribution of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and related their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness of doses over a 15 mg daily dose was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior is related to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an antipsychotic therapy also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolution, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the signs and symptoms of a late dysentanesthesia are treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study containing a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events with aria treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary action of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg aria per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omechatzol) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the lack of data on the safety of humans and due to the concerns that arise in the animal studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazzol and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"manic episodes in bipolar I disturbance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from semi-surgery."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazzol and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term efficacy phase, over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely monitored laboratory parameters emerged, yielded no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"cavities of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dysentinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdoses with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a potentially agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergigen and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"when using Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks on healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, on the Nucleus caudatus and on putative."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, in comparison to placebo, Aripiprazole showed a significantly stronger improvement of the psychotic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in one half-operation-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients who had a response to the study mediate were similar in both groups (Aripiprazzol 77% and semi-surgery (73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in semi-surgery."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazzol showed a significantly higher rate of decline that was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo versus placebo in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"also in week 12, Aripiprazzol showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, with or without psychotic symptoms, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole indicated a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a reversal into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazole, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean age of Elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' ('poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, nor did a pharmacokinetic study show schizophrenic effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of the pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on its metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated application, toxic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not recognize any particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they only have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinkles toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal-rinds carcinoma (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of Aripiprazole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, concentrations of the sulfate-conjugates found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile ducts, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane has been studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">"Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to the other human insulin analog."</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actrophane must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the complete list of the package contents)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actrophane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the distribution of Actrophane in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"for example, patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly through an intensified insulin therapy can perceive hypoglycemia warnings and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, bipolar, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA versus insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage required."</seg>

<seg id="876">Some patients who appeared hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"before travelling, which goes over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics therefore should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of operation is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or retarded resorption.</seg>

<seg id="1641">"usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that binds, supports and supports other structures in the body) are affected."</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"the virus in Advexin is a" Adenovirus, "which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"Advexin should have injected directly into the tumors, and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"the p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defect in the human body, normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored."</seg>

<seg id="1648">"after the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions he was asking, some questions were still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents the CHMP prepares a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"according to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injections of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours will benefit patients."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient."</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drug release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are cluttered."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when considering all hay fever symptoms, except constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who alone took pseudoephedrine."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who alone benefited."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aero (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heartburn), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotorical hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension caused stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the transportation of aerinaze throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this can be attributed to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergocipitin, pergociamin, dopedrine, ephedrine, oxygenazolin, Naphazolin etc."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient collective and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations on dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate recommendations on dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">"patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be removed."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded."</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experience from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be a dizziness which may result in impaired ability to transport or to serve machines."</seg>

<seg id="1689">"these include both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin on endothelial cells."</seg>
<seg id="1690">"in a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including strengthening subjective lack of drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"the oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"in both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"the efficacy of aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic background."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the perortic application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the equilibrium balance of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolised."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine organic equivalent was the exposure after giving an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"however, based on the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not recognize any particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseudoephedrine."</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="2614">"in the case of chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185)."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"in comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients)."</seg>
<seg id="2616">"in March 2005, the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the placing of Aloxi in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">"the efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding a Corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy."</seg>
<seg id="2619">"because Palonosetron can lengthen the colon cleanse, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection."</seg>
<seg id="2620">"as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or that tend to be such an extension."</seg>
<seg id="2621">"in addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi is not used in the days after chemotherapy, neither for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"in preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor activity in the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C)."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"in a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady state- concentration oral methoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"in clinical trials, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly associated with Aloxi, were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%)."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports."</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; no dose-active relationships could be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">"no dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large volume of distribution, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy for alopxide overdosing."</seg>
<seg id="2630">"in two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of cycetron (half-life 7.3 hours) received, which was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"in a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy of ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously at day 1."</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from studies of moderate chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron were comparable."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"according to clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was to evaluate the ECG effects of palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to IV administration a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations is followed by a gradual elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ of / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous dosage of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a unique intravenous administration of 0.75 mg, however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time indication of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms per kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal's terminal life time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified by this."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum humanoid exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 Pre-clinical studies have indicated that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retarded in more patients than in the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection related to crusts) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be caused by methicillinate Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not work against this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface should not be more than 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both trials were taken together in house hours, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (freezing cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the placing place.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo have outweighed the following superficial skin infections over the risks: • Impetigo, infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the market launch of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully removed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on a scraped skin or infected superficial wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skimped skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to be weighed between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo used, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the date of delivery that concerned about 1% of patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retinamulin is based on selective inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptidyltransmitters, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50-ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of the resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were found in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be taken into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">"in 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by helping the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can defend itself against illness."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and generates antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccination approved since 1996 and the vaccination of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix introduced one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B."</seg>

<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, insufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels are achieved, so that in these cases the administration of additional vaccines may be necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intraarterial injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation disturbances, however, ambient matrix can be injected subcutaneous as an exception as it may result in bleeding after intramuscular administration."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body cannot produce enough insulin to control glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in a study of 878 adults, Apidra was studied in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, after six months a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin analog."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection in the area of abdominal wall, thighs or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of abdominal bags."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"because of the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc deficiency, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can undergo a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active agent of the used insulin and can therefore change during the treatment of the treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances which can increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous gait of insulin-ulisines the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in the normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin granulisin showed a disproportionate glucoseside effect in the therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucoseside effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin analog and achieves the full glucoseside effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin analog.</seg>
