the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made to the translations without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself where you can directly insert texts to be translated .
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enh@@ ancements ... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of default settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which is &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page which has brought down , or the list of crashes , if any , delete . &quot;
the view filter module ( also known as folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in a variety of ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : feature , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a wider view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ view , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can either represent depth for easy detection of ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for display or whether the area of lower rec@@ tan@@ gles may be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ view , this target is not always maintained . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how division of the area of an entry takes place for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is advisable for cap@@ tion and to avoid space losses due to frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View to hold on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the module image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the look of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Pictures per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the File Name box in the image , specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
display the image size of the image to indicate whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
view the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery with the image size check box .
&quot; in the dialog folder , place where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the Save file in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set up the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotation field until which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
with the original pictures copy you determine whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to hear into the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser Rec@@ ogni@@ tion adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , with which you can change browser and operating system identification for individual domains , this is useful for web pages that allow access only with specific browsers . &quot;
&quot; standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identification in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access to browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E Brow@@ ser@@ ID to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; call Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting . &quot;
with the menu entry Con@@ figuration ... you can set the scope of the information about the used browser and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the website &apos;s website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Extras website . you can perform the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML , check if your &amp; HTML ; document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches all found errors will be displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets included in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used .
&quot; check the links on your site on forwarding and er@@ ron@@ eous links . recur@@ sively , all links on the website are checked . &quot;
here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets fixed .
with the Web @-@ Archi@@ ver module for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save websites with text and pictures in the .@@ html format .
&quot; click on Tools Site with the mouse , and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;
&quot; the Web @-@ Archi@@ ver module is copyright &amp; copy ; 2001 @-@ 2003 Andreas Schl@@ ap@@ bach , Antonio Lar@@ os@@ sa and Mal@@ te Star@@ os@@ tik schl@@ p@@ b@@ ch @ i@@ am@@ .@@ ch lar@@ os@@ sa @ k@@ de@@ .org mal@@ te @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ albums download . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use these to view , comment and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works entirely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG Export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the program , the Help menu contains a page in the error reporting system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; are , then we would like to encourage you to answer any other user &apos;s mailing list . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ;
the best start to get involved is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you first start , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ no@@ k is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will additionally use as an al@@ ben@@ libr@@ ar@@ .@@ Settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ search recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can not exclude sub @-@ folders unless it was in hidden folder . this allows you to include ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can insert a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as the base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and this is used as an album symbol . see the Albums tab for more details . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam across your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My C@@ utter button to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the help of raw camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ albums download . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by digi@@ K@@ am . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to say is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures will work everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type sel@@ ector allows you to undo the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure the settings in the dialog of the settings . &quot;
&quot; all photos , edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select the album title menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
album Date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with View Sam@@ ples After Date Sor@@ ting .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , new ester : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ code ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ als ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview &quot; &quot; ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ came ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait short while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can change editing settings . select here the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails area to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction into the main window displays such help window .
&quot; photo editing shows your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to these . you can select all the features that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ code . you can select all the features that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ code . you can choose between viewing images , sli@@ deshow or editing of images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image processing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail on the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ code ; delete , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My dates list ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . as a result , you can lo@@ gically organize your tags . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My sample word ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be applied to the keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the picture itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My C@@ auses &amp; quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select the album as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My C@@ auses &amp; quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also click the thumb@@ nail on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have added a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window when you preview the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , right click the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords Menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time@@ frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box indicating the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ end er Such@@ box is a small lamp that becomes green when searching for hits . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit the search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Tools for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are linked by operators separated , listed . an option can be added to this list using the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ TH@@ ING . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to be compared by comparing these sign@@ atures . the less the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you click a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edited ; find the appropriate images . also here a threshold value can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel , or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ code ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ table added from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you what copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pair @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the toolbar , then the first two images will be automatically loaded into the fields to compare . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lamp table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right panel of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom in as well as in other views . just use the zoom slider below the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in . this happens in both pictures when you are previ@@ ewed in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , evaluation , reporting , archiving , optimizing , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents which have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; edited ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc ; note that you have to switch to a larger disk at some point . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option to be saved to the file &apos;s settings page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign any photo &apos;s keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , because you can concentrate on the best photos while working . &quot;
&quot; let us now use keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs , or do categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded sampling words , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images in the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure of how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you are going to understand . &quot;
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE also provides you with a sp@@ ell@@ ch@@ ecker . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is already moving at speed .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ alization are innum@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels by means of images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open to Google Earth . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ code ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may be titles as : Emplo@@ ye@@ e Phot@@ ographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who does the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can only be of little interest in the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated prud@@ ently and you can no longer trust them for a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that appears to cause miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray Disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers retain your stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : a disk study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some errors fixed by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ minent failure . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed actu@@ ators look different . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip , but remember that not every connector also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage disturbances that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also include protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order . if you buy a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , remember always to recognize all the cables before you go on vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system is at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not affected by transmission problems at present , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss of the not@@ ebook and 46 % for the work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant , while the technology further develops , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . so you frequently backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole area or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vent always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , there is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional th@@ inning should happen manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving pictures and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alisation , viewing devices , ... , usage of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable on account of your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert your library . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t attach it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source , / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignments on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open source image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ Tags , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussion and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the camera images are on the camera , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you use the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ code ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were trun@@ cated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print , etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ code ; in the addition of a photo to an album you can add a description , as you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , connect it to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file name and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
&quot; the metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ came ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired &amp; k@@ de selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case the new images with a star in the preview window have been selected . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is shown , as normal folders are sorted , displayed . the list of existing albums is shown , like normal folders , shown in the My Albums tab . select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by removing the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you must first select it and delete the deleted ones afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the cam@@ er@@ aman , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not meaningful names . the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the first two affect the information about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ al section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the Pre@@ fix Photo % Y % H : % M : % S . to do this , switch the date &amp; time option . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you will have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation while downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata page , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and click OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to associate a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ x@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format because this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ signs hair@@ pin coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ came ; change . to access these settings , you need to select Settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be set to preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . this can be descriptions such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to indicate that the photo offers . this must not be the author if this is a picture agency , e.g. Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without being lost .
&quot; save image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is resting in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; Alb@@ um@@ file , which has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; each time you open the lamp table , these settings are switched on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar once you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TI@@ FF files , you can switch the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; you can save loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata is not yet supported but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . at present it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard reference is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance that is based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the spot@@ lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned into , because of the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights , as it shows the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast enough to satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ came ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ stru@@ t , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the cinem@@ at@@ ography options of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial data captured by the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w will provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adaptive Hom@@ ogen@@ as Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , since you are performed during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how it should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other so that the colors are as exact as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in image editing / Cre@@ ate color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile folder Sets the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ ke@@ yst@@ one . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correc@@ ts for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not for Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image editing ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and they will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; in the menu under Settings , you can set short commands for tasks executed by modules . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check if &amp; digi@@ code ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window Cam@@ eras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a picture in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; edited ; you , if it is to delete them from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; use to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the toolbar settings . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
&quot; image processing contains a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ um@@ ber , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved the Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu from the File menu or using the button &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore &quot; &quot; button restore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving . &quot;
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by editing or restoring it by editing again from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo , and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ producing . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture up , picture down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change it in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; see this section for setting up image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five Reiter is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
&quot; the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a review scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field , which follows the scheme in the following table : &quot;
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ p@@ id ; session used keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the typ@@ ed keyword . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed several keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate connection fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IP@@ TC keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the keyword filter page bar is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ a- , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword is already existing , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter refers to no keywords , which reduces the quantity to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any startup of the program . it can also be switched from different settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and have created and determine that it should be one or its , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set a Advanced search through all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group group@@ ing . the options will then look like this : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adjusted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed resp@@ . scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those from your camera or scanner , and that the colours you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all of the six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other images are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everybody , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work in s@@ RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB states that your ; on@@ itor is s@@ RGB , then you must either c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ tr@@ ast Exp@@ and from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; similar : this method uses the color of the color of the selected image to adjust the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel as flat as possible . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic calibration : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a real@@ time of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the picture . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim them down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . each adjustment of the white balance you have set can then be saved into a text file and then loaded again .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button brings all filter values back to their default values and the related neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save these settings , your original picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done through the window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles can be used to consult chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool is to find color value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to use multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool color effects will provide you with four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a kan@@ ten@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was called Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when you replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar activity . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . all your adjustments can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; when you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is a key correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders for the purposes described here . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls and observe how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ches can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this choos@@ er box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera mostly linear mode is the most meaningful . linear mode creates a wide beam for images with large areas of a constant color . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixel tags are darker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photo is a red marker . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve depicting the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and Lo@@ ad : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , that is , you only get the effect displayed in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code channel mixer ; image processing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ours Channel Mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are at the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you switch the corresponding color components . this is especially convenient if you also activate the Mon@@ och@@ rome option . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the noise . color @-@ like consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setup can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also , with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ ther Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks great , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
red filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red l@@ enti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at daylight time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 co@@ cc@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm and medium sounds while it adds a bit of col@@ dness in the shade tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ec@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother , and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your picture regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right hei@@ gh@@ tens the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool boxes can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
to keep the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put his attention to a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under image frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly the picture str@@ anded with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ fire effect and decorative lining with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . &quot;
&quot; each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool sten@@ cil you can put a template on a picture .
the menu templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates above a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to decrease the file size of the template . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview strip of the templates automatically . &quot;
beneath the thumb@@ nail you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generated especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works at the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per . actually , it does not shar@@ pen any bit , it works rather psych@@ edel@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ izing .
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process can be combined with minimal differences to one colour point . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used internally . pictures in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
some scann@@ ers use a sharpen@@ er already while reading the image . if you disable this you will get control of your image .
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness of the edges increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image intensi@@ fies the tool . below re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu item Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window will show the output of the filter using the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will create close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius turns one like many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore plastic defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted dra@@ ining filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of an blur@@ red mask .
&quot; the cast &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the swelling pix@@ ies removed far from the original qu@@ ell pixel . the FI@@ R Viennese In@@ verse of the G@@ auss cle@@ av@@ age is also very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; a circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in the correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; use this parameter if your blur@@ red g@@ auss is wrong . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cli@@ pping , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , non @-@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ ring a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
even under optimal conditions the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colouring has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
you can read a technical comparison in English under this address for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital images .
the G@@ lät@@ te controls the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
tool error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify rest@@ au@@ ration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details such that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
&quot; direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated by a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise exists , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be placed higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ scale da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles make a long run time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny h@@ ash that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive Filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance vari@@ ance of the image . we recommend that you change colour or light density to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change colour or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is checked by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the image toler@@ ances of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically harder to smoke . however , it also eliminates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu item Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
&quot; this Rest@@ oration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . smooth@@ ing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is performed with another tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ ia and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &quot; &quot; ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any adjustment of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with identical noise is being restored . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera recorded on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ dation on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph caused by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . you can see the original image below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows Hot@@ pixels of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi Project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
upload this file to the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filtering method . all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to polish the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses also show this behaviour under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; however , many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter that increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in circumstances such that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ red effects can occur through movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and the color or gray scales of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , which means an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , un@@ locks it to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction decreases the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the engra@@ ver correc@@ ts the distant edges opposite to that of the second grade . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the thickness of distortion second degrees . negative values can be corrected to correct ton@@ n@@ al distor@@ tions and positive values of cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion . this value appears more strongly than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the verti@@ ces have the opposite sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus performs a correction of first gra@@ des .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed in front of all cutting or size changes . preferably , perform this correction as all first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ n@@ al correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal assistance line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . then move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . then you can correct the ton@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform@@ ers File menu or via the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gra@@ dation and sensitivity of film ( ISO ) . activate the Option joining film gra@@ dation if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes colour channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel , it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the spot@@ lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter film gra@@ dation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ dation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films producers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ dation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used phot@@ os@@ ensi@@ tivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
&quot; the lines , which define the outlines of the drawing , are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients must change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter Grav@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted by another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Be@@ en .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ry : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels by a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taking photos from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by means of a random shift of pixels , simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera . &quot;
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes those without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will stay free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction through mirr@@ oring or rotating . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you zoom in a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the Ri@@ der New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise exists , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be placed higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . magni@@ fying each capture for photo can be saved as a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear default enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Edit button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , always the greater value of the height and the lateral aspect ratio is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; with the Max . ratio button below , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio sel@@ ects its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the support settings allow help to fade , so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us bowl or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the gold pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides smo@@ other relief lines when you put a picture together . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ el@@ bow , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ t from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be placed dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot;
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . now you can aff@@ ix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after turning a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the transforming blan@@ king feature from image editing .
an elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
turn left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is s@@ me@@ ared a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming blan@@ ks from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; this is no rotation , the picture is distorted . in other words , a right angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about Transform@@ ers sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; create your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical corners . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the placement tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two certific@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming blan@@ ks from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available are dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions which have been edited and edited . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia .
image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ less if it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can also convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ came ; see Con@@ figuration section for more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that &amp; digi@@ came ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies .

&quot; if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; edited ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; use a unified dialog type that indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you see &amp; quot ; texture &quot; &quot; ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower part to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the picture from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel , or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the P@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor under the button Color is activated , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the copy , cut and paste actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a poin@@ ter character , if another color follows . if so , if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , it can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graphs ; includes , are based on the program author &apos;s ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;

&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ Graph@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs required . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . you can also remember that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ graphs viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you can choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it afterwards with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed over several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the Up@@ loading page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ time model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ its man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm performs the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . with such a layout command , you can output the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; - Algorith@@ ms specific options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ chtet ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ) for directed ones .
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will appear if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
show the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; click with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ Graph@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images and provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so this works you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item Pictures , a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default value duc@@ rr@@ h in order to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ tioning - &gt; Screen shot ... a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete desktop read only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot was made , the dialog window appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management online . Fli@@ ck@@ r is able to show your photos to the people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication so it is virtually your passport to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
after the successful login the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . press the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words . these are added to the picture as keywords during upload .
&quot; with the Op@@ ens , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as Priv@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before upload , the photos are changed before upload in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Galerie @-@ Export module is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate geographic coordinates in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization of cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above looking dialog appears then . in order to create a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed , which indicates coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera area must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera measurement . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have done a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens up the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be switched between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages form to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab sel@@ ects all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right will show you a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default view viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all of your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which , of course , affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or displacement . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of color information takes place . this is also reflected in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy it from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tool and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
you first need to select the images that are to be taken into the m@@ peg slide . then you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
&quot; the images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting images or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should set it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the sli@@ deshow once you &apos;re back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that Ko@@ di@@ ver or Tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tool and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings button below . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module directly .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter windows then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information on your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or use them later on , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting with the trigger button . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write an existing file . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can click OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t be sure to send too many pictures at one time . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format below the image file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the closing button you can close this window . &quot;
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant image transitions via Open@@ GL . however , you must own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option file names indicate that the file name of the images will appear in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually start with Es@@ c .
the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect for each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have completed your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through them , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information to view your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see image . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are visible . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a thumb@@ nail image , that is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to display images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you can use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search window in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the box lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total dat@@ as , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images on specific names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos . &quot;
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time start or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline , drag the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages , you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . read more about the export files in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed on the HTML pages . for example , all images are displayed by a party . for example , all images are exported from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not addressed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who look at your website and have a monitor who supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any more images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if it wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the pictures , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even make it again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is just a link to images . the advantage of saving all the pictures into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file as independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images will be described , which you can access via the Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when the Manual is checked near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so simply select the export file option .
&quot; the last option of this page is Maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu , then it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories to be imported into the imported file and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can synchron@@ ize the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; you just have to be able to browse pictures and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will learn the different steps from ( 1 ) determination of information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button press on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , e.g. objects , animals or albums . &quot;
see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
&quot; in the Options section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialog options you can set up entire groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list of options above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand side of the list you can select the category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface .
&quot; the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because modules from several applications are used together with each other , it may be possible that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always try out new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which just matches the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album must have &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here is &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , it will do so , so if you had selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the settings dialog and select modules you want to load modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you can see from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a toolbar at the top of the toolbar . at the moment , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . , for example , you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . &quot;
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you can always use them again and again , when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; if you have , for example , a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards , the persons find and classi@@ fy them more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located beneath the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to classi@@ fy this item in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also create a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to display this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the preview images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you do not set filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in fact , you have to have the pictures stored somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not saved on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy them . so if you want to avoid annoying how the mess of your pictures would be avoided , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those that you may want to see for others , and click the current view bar in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister is allowed to see , and unlock the menu item Any@@ thing except current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures locked so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and the other can remove or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to with@@ hold the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see the appropriate entries for this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as sli@@ deshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move in and zoom in the picture . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ oming in the center of the image and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the key key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the &quot; &quot; Power Button &quot; &quot; the zo@@ oms turns , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom @-@ operations that function in videos that are in and out with the plus and sub @-@ key .
the screen@@ shot function from the context menu allows you to rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with characteristics while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view of a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have highlighted features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you print all the pictures you edit , print , or whatever you selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in dre front view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case it allows you to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way , you can undo your common one later . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will appear with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed item with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the properties pane . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the properties pane and a small example of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for moves . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a existing view , pull the connector down to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , then drag the finger in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the connector onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left pointing at the top pointing left . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the toolbar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window ordering ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry screen render . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the &quot; &quot; render settings &quot; &quot; icon in the toolbar or in the View menu of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the size of the map , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image editing to render into the input fields . &quot;
in combination quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly re@@ divided and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 pixels will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the threshold of the threshold , then the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and tested for further sub@@ division . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , modify &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for Ren@@ der@@ ns quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on comp@@ utes . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can specify whether the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit the object . &quot;
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete set of commands by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the Help in the Properties @-@ View , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation on the displayed object . here you will find the path to your document and the version . support are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a board pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a board pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the Window Reg@@ ulations section , it explains how you can create and save window arrangements . &quot;
drop down standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window ordering when starting the program .
the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button del@@ etes .
each window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with the card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to render , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything error @-@ free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window ordering :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination of the camera . simply click the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you click App@@ ly or enter the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( In@@ sert End Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then click on the App@@ ly button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the plane , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the ground to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose the first object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview look how the pigment appears now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matte black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . now , keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the Qu@@ ader and sphere in the preview , click App@@ ly to the App@@ ly button and then click the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should simply execute this step , as you should have already understood the basic method of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has moved over the bottom , as you have shifted the bottom by one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er can offer . hopefully , you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the Ren@@ derer rises hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved version are dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last @-@ done command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
save the current window ordering and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; C@@ oo@@ fing show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ shows ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or if all images will always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in Dialog One - &amp; C@@ oo@@ fing show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ es show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ shows ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start will open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; cu@@ ff show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that the program can also display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; C@@ oo@@ fing show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ term display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short @-@ term display .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam project .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to it , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will display a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; it is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ phot@@ ; , then we would like to encourage you to answer any other user &apos;s mailing list ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; . &quot;
&quot; try to give as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to select in the settings show@@ piece ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer do than scan and store images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes as pictures to scan and store . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command chan@@ g@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel is to exit &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image is saved and scre@@ ed ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite , then select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images , and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Help button starts K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; channel .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global short@@ cuts can be set by right @-@ clicking into the player window and selecting short commands ... Select . &quot;
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they operate as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this makes your keyboard available for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user can see why a script is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
the scripts / templates folder contains a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is using command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in every K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow you to run external programs and commands . this usually uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . when a script is started Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being pi@@ ped . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
customize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be recognized with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cap@@ aci@@ fication of amar@@ ca script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; you may already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the bas@@ eline of the Amar@@ ok springs to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details . &quot;
&quot; activating Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; in addition to the play@@ lists , the player window will turn on or off the player window . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; creating mood : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , so the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; store mood files in music files : this feature is only available when compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save play@@ lists when moving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist while moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; when changes are made visible when changing the play , the play@@ lists window opens / rolls to keep the running piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when switching to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is picked up . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize your appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; playback at the start will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD @-@ colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen in a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the audio @-@ output card allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is still further setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on the machine , enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece as required .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces played and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; call up similar performers : after enabling this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar performers to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok just needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ) . we have written a little tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features , such as the O@@ SD , require that your window manager will comply with the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
mostly it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the Met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l , the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please bear in mind only one error if there is something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been changed to the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the playlist of the playlist and select column view . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist , and drop it down there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist to the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . check for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible by right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end @-@ independent approach , so the actual question must be supported by What media types are supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . gam@@ ers can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 co@@ de , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution . for gam@@ ers , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ aler ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just want to listen to a white noise . gam@@ ers read the file , de@@ code it and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System Control Centre and increase the sound buffer size ( see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less fli@@ cker react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
&quot; if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the recently @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the stream @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
&quot; if you have a list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how to find out what is currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running program : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ ra@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ pane . press on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changing window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button brings a piece in the click order into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser you want to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens up a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , trace F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; this basically fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then , you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all the other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the item and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata . &quot;
the developers do not want you to dict@@ ate when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in the General settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings tool boxes ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... Visual Con@@ text Browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to browse &amp; control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio rob@@ ats are fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; you have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to install and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator , then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up under settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sampling rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be looked after further . you may of course gladly take this issue yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new urgently needed supervis@@ or for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very simple ! for this reason there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or the wizard just don &apos;t like , then this Quick Start Guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection makes it easy to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of a button in the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select action audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burn menu .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . &quot;
this chapter explains how all the features of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used ; including creating a collection and playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running ly@@ ric display showing the currently running stream or the current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q button are also activated under the running text display . the PL button is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting up equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Classic to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of features deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information shown there is now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . besides , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the straight running piece , as well as the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , the artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click this icon to copy the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you can find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images may have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highly rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the single areas to start playing right away . you can also right click on it and select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , you try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , so no running text script is required . &quot;
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - At first the pieces will be sorted by artist , and below it will be a further split after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers . &quot;
&quot; group interpretation / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and among them by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings for the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; the search filter contains a selection box , with which you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select various time windows , from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This lists the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this function will insert the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . they are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , which promp@@ ts it to appear among various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
pick up marker mark - Chan@@ ges a compilation of marked album back to a normal album . after that the album is no longer listed under Vari@@ ous performers but again under the associated interpreter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub @-@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar contains a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not meet your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can use music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thus dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter the letters , just press the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then include the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ looking for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either Mike Old@@ field contain or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you find the Add button that you can add to the playlist pieces . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow the back and restore buttons . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window by right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse double into the respective display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , you can disable the status bar in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by right @-@ clicking into the player window , or by clicking on menu in the playlist . &quot;
click on this entry to open the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . here you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these play@@ lists later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio rob@@ ats ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of assign@@ able mix and playlist mix fill in your playlist right away and you can start playing directly . the recommended pieces start with an empty playlist , and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again . &quot;
the New Fil@@ l button inserts the current playlist and adds new pieces to dynamic mode . playlist editing opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in consideration of the selected pieces . &quot;
&quot; pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , you will add random items from each of the play@@ lists you have checked . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts to install on script . a new entry will pop up in which a script package will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
&quot; if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that when re@@ encoding to MP3 you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ s@@ less format . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the machine finished the burning process .
&quot; this quick guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as the original of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium on which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&quot; to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) . &quot;
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback on community help from forums and get news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program fires audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Norm@@ ally automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; with FF@@ MPEG it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
&quot; trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you will need it , if you want to read a DVD . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced in a variety of ways . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog box Save As is shown with which you can choose the folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call Save for each single project file saving .
&quot; if a project is modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what should happen , just as if you were calling for each project file close . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project that is un@@ saved will be asked what will happen , as if you were calling file C@@ lose . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to be added to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project .
&quot; this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the media , it only removes the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also choose cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD that you can burn later on . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the medium used . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the short@@ cut order below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is designed to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is decisive , which of the enclosed programs will give you the preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD , and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copyright ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String node ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; now l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and saved to WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ for@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are already installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but only the enco@@ der packages need to be installed , which are needed . if e.g. FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ sh Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handles the protection , it is not possible to handle copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup dialog needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily usage to read out a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , with everything being manually entered . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; on request , the CD@@ DB will start asking the CD @-@ data in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . it should be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file will be selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psych@@ o @-@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have the most common audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resul@@ t@@ ant compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all songs of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and aut@@ os@@ est@@ o@@ ols . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t of l@@ ame and the title must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering into the machine . it is worth not@@ ing that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not attorney . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively selected a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirr@@ oring servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reader program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and therefore the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver pack@@ et must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ver is found in the chapter Wel@@ sh Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step @-@ by @-@ step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any read one &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once . &quot;
the device identi@@ fier is handed over to the les@@ bian program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab helps with the records of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only for incomplete information , select , so that you will be informed if information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down box is simpler , will be a &amp; CD ; record found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; it is associated with a low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB , consider this twice as if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; htt@@ p protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to give &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is one reason why more than one is at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; disc@@ ard the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously coding WAV files : with a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , is described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section , must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best matches your opinion . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the commentary box . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der , in order to get more information . &quot;
&quot; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover dates of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the play list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or from . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; if you click the selection process button to start reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; on the tab , click on the order window to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read just on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did ... &quot;
this section is aimed at people who compile source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive is located ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you want to read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you succeeded in obtaining the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time editing of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; when you finish playing a song , the next time k@@ mid starts again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will display the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ pane can drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that a piece automatically starts once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played in succession . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template , and change the playing speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space key acts like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set up a song . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played according to the series . in this section , you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection below the item Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs from the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the each one in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add a song . it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select The series from the sub@@ menu back@@ order of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is set anew . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song , select the Previous piece button , select the previous section from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection you want to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change patch to B@@ right piano in the events of Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to attach to the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboard boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the provided Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name Name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all occur@@ ren@@ ces will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there is no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not shine anymore green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the tones played . view the View menu under the View channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before that , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; co@@ quer@@ or on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or to play a file just enter the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without having to add it to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic Add to Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program further on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ ofs . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ k @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , please count with me as I may already have the file . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I want to emphasize that I only want to program more because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; thanks also Jose Lu@@ z San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a correction or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found also on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played to each other , you should use the Perman@@ ent Play@@ list category . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and play begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . to do this simply click on a name of a category , then select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose Play@@ list from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when you leave edit mode or select another group without having to match the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 , if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; all must be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash can be played with the sw@@ f@@ j @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the embed embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in K@@ DE setting dialog . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the Back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course , only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should re@@ play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Players ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings can be found under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be seen on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; dump ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used for the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be included ; / DVD can be used . &quot;
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or if you want to compile &amp; Ki@@ le , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and learn about its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can directly start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ oun@@ cement : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; same as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ each { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the quick entry wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a convenient feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be created is weigh@@ ed : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; scan &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : hereby the character encoding is set . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be weigh@@ ed ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they have to be balanced only in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is saved through the modest appearance of the output file . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , this function will automatically create an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu item box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the source search can be very helpful . once a DVI ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information like the font and is next to PDF , the output file of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the source code search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section on the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding site is moved in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is getting &quot; &quot; getting &quot; , &quot; and there is no call to &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when considering the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be sorted out . the selection fields have been developed for fast integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ sible &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Ad@@ ditional section is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , strokes , or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or other element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ res@@ e will be used for the definition of the font size . it can be used to specify the font sizes for the main text , the gro@@ oves , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning it can also be done in the text .
&quot; once the source code above is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is using the construction or button of the button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for saving it automatically .
&quot; if the document comp@@ iling is not recommended , it should be searched for errors during logging . when using high @-@ speed construction , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font list 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then add the change of the font size within the area , &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ling . &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the \ \ command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is presented , follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code the conversion into wanted other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . simply set Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Construction will be balanced .
&quot; to start the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be placed in a line of the source code and then be cli@@ cked on default search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; must be opened and applied to the corresponding line . this must be set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if you do not open the &amp; DVI ( s ) , a mistake may be made . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file explains the source code in the source code . in the editor , the bugs can be used for jumps between errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written or used by the wizard for the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a new file , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this manner the following steps have to be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template will then be balanced instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if a simple way is used to create a template , search for one on the Internet and search through the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; posters ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can directly start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be inv@@ oked by La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ click on the button to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , portions of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility of browsing the various types of source code and high@@ lighting these . for example the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assistants can add additional jumps within the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . this jump marks the jump to the next or last mark . in doing so , this jump marker is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already offers excellent opportunities , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; key features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; also supported by many environments and groups and therefore supported &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit sel@@ ections , the following commands are included for text selection : &quot;
&quot; he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word in the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to listen to part of the document , natural this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a quicker option . under Edit Del@@ ete , the following commands are included in the text of the text : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to Edit drop@@ shipping paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit surrounding for a possible simple job with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the \ \ begin { surrounding } command will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly lose sight of the surrounding environment . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are specified by braces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some key commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted group par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview should be lost quickly . this command will close the last open group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as a guide . for the purpose @-@ induc@@ ing implementation , the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used &quot; . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and carries two close call@@ sign marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double sign sign can be set up in Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
language specific settings ( eg@@ . n@@ german or French ) can also be used for German or French registration marks . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when shifting shift ; Enter key for &amp; box ; an intelligent line switch . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with a complete line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to attain this . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; according to the next tab , add &amp; box ; in some spaces for the column position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) have been added . there are three different modes available . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ end { surrounding } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and this will allow you to decrease the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump marks can be captured , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible and the desired parameters can then be captured . &quot;
&quot; settings box ; set up ... box ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders , as well as wishes of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a few letters will have to be entered with \ \ begin and the call of complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete edit mode over the appropriate setting or the key root Alt + Shift key Space key , the command to e@@ mit the environment is automatically gre@@ ased and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be resum@@ ed in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
under Settings box ; set up ... box ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of encryption mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of crashes , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be set up under Settings ... for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated over the editing of a full set of C@@ trl + Alt key , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character string . &quot;
&quot; great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter books are not helpful for automatic comprehen@@ sion . however , it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once . thus &amp; Ki@@ le , the complete registration for all already written documents . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up box in the menu Settings ... box can be burned down . here , also the threshold value can be specified for displaying the execution . &quot;
&quot; the complete data can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( registry ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is selected , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are grouped in group mode in the creation of comp@@ iling , creating change and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command fast , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... In this case the following information for the project is asked :
&quot; when using the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all the programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for a certain format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k containing a database of all documents and documents , and there@@ for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a source code and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be implemented on all systems with the installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project causing &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all use in compliance with the &amp; GNU license . &quot;

&quot; with the command line interface , you can edit random sign@@ atures or day sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides the sign@@ atures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for accidental sign@@ atures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; not@@ ch ; by many sign@@ atures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sign@@ atures the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day , use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures , you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; and paste in the lower section of your new signature ; and add your signature in the lower section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the symbol with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar . &quot;

&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging Insp@@ ect ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the emerging dialog . &quot;
&quot; all templates found here are listed here . it should be noted that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT are valid . therefore , multiple templates can be present with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking on a template in the shown list moves the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variable are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new X@@ Path can be chosen by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text hand in the main window will be moved to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has been familiar with my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . do we even lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application requires a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ aring work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said before , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply leave the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be insp@@ ected by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know only whether the file well @-@ formed is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review option . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection necessary . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL , processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may already be selected , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have la@@ gged , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even maybe little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the plu@@ gged in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to identify unique identi@@ fications .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something specific happens . see in for more detailed information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that are executed when something is done in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CVS as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note that note is simple . either the comment -@@ entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the assigned nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Groß / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
autom@@ ate acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the standard specifications can be restored using the standard button .
&quot; standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that during a power ou@@ tage or crash the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default next start is useful when the user interface has changed by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / hanging views . it comp@@ lies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Stru@@ cture Tree Con@@ figuration , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep should be opened automatically when changing the structure tree . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , divided . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ isi@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin drop@@ down sel@@ ector the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the support functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action causes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so it is not necessary to pay attention to that . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with using a browser to view the current document .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and regularly send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug application has started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression should be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a k@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the Tag folder and the toolbar buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or generated automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific tags for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties tab that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for quick paste insert into a document without any risk of a sp@@ elling error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only appear once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain anything as a single entity type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for Type method . specifies the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; specifies an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed , etc ; this is a only element type element . &quot;
specifies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
defines the attribute value of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ - &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; sub@@ stitutes . this will not cause any leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
here is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; here is an example of a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; days &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DT@@ D settings . for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New promotion leads to the same dialog :
&quot; this action assigned keyboard short@@ cuts . by clicking the Custom button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting variable in the command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus added : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / is removed from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for the control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , at the default input . in the input field , you can specify what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard error output . it can be specified which is to be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the value in the output dialog : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use , enable &quot; Edit day &quot; dialog when available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly used as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ .@@ html tag = tag@@ 3@@ html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , now see the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 / PHP 4.2 documentation = table of content , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference = basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
notice the # of Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of boxes ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it for yourself .
you note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently displayed at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash folder ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; the contents section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else whom . in different places there is an email @-@ sent menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to add an article to this article , we recommend to sign the resources , for which we need a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool rails , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work in XML languages which are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can start from the DT@@ D menu and convert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string containing HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , can be adapted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to be able to draw full use out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all card tra@@ ilers , rel@@ o@@ ad , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing area leads to a further context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . presently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
&quot; if you want to insert a tag that represents the tag , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the display with card holders stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ hes of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented application system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of Web technology for your development to find . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed . &quot;
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D currently used and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if they receive a toolbar in an email they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot;
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developed , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; - sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using com@@ man@@ ders , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze a script language syntax . ( read more about it in . ) &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly evolved into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ old Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converts special characters to &amp; HTML by inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ scription , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
turn the block sel@@ ector on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
disman@@ tling and activating the problem porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project toolbar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings actions ... and you will be asked when you want , whether you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; removing a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
refresh / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder does not exist fails the loading .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , when this day contradic@@ ts the rules in this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will de@@ activate it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schemes depends on the type ; version .
&quot; choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode which represents the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you can find details . &quot;
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ unprecedented ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the configuration of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ ready scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
leave if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is started anew from scratch does not hook .
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the check , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards are possible ) ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ files section , up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited , or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the Event Con@@ figuration window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
by default it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open another project select Project Open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project structure gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , however , the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu accessible with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; allows you to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will remain in the kernel memory and forget about programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created to load the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is saved on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened , or deleted from the project toolbar in the project or project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best viewed from the toolbar of the toolbar . usage and addition differ . adding toolbar buttons is discussed below in the Ad@@ ding of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new actions , a new toolbar can be executed , which can be executed in the dialog , where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set Settings actions .. set .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates in principle like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; templates supplied have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a few examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are to be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for entire sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , grouped in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc ; ) and select File As template Save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged and dra@@ gging on the tree view templates . &quot;
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used to drag and drop or insert via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and secure site template . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ text he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link them with them . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template index . if a root folder is set , it would generally turn off templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows leading or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers through copying contents templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( to show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one location to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the button press activ@@ ates the active cursor from one window to another , while the position in the document is retained . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set by settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small package for fast computers and a large range for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created , which is used to reduce the encoding of the V@@ PL ; thus , you can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below , e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is possible just as with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is used as usual in a word processor , by moving with arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the button or Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text is inserted , each other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some toolbar buttons such as the table wizard or lists wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to be able to successfully compile , use except &amp; k@@ de ; the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path input . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style template file names with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder , for example , is a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a for@@ age named my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified model name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with each my@@ riad that contains the template template . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g --@@ -@@ --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ -@@ --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ --@@ par@@ am ; --@@ long &amp; lt ; _ ; --@@ --@@ --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ st@@ d@@ out --@@ pre @-@ art + X@@ SL@@ Source + X@@ ML@@ Data

&quot; adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if --@@ repeat is twice a second , the conversion will run 100 times &quot;
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this is enabled in Lib@@ XML
enables the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document if the support for it has been activated in Lib@@ XML . this is turned on as default .
&quot; on systems with the Re@@ ad@@ line installed , you can scroll up / down with the arrow keys on / off through the running memory of the previously executed orders . &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 @-@ 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Uni@@ xes or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . &quot;
&quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ vag@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
one function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you merge and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences , le@@ aning against the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check codes , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example : &quot;
k@@ diffusion 3 Fol@@ der @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field for the target is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately set up a output file . you can also do this later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also drag and drop them : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( note that the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white symbols are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break@@ age is enabled , the line is scored on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the results window . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys for editing . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ up ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ up ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , there must be distinction between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , however , you will automatically copy the option selection . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the line return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line @-@ ending of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; neither with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( Menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed sc@@ ast@@ ly . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically introduces an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a jack character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; while merging , this option will be disabled . during merging , this option must be disabled . in default , this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensively search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving on to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C function for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merging menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge . for details , see documentation on directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will app@@ end the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backing . &quot;
&quot; adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you have to exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the encoding fields for coding , a brief reference appears as to what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded transfer column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just print out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window side by side or merge . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes consider the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given to this external command at first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for line spac@@ ing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processing command for line spac@@ ing to turn the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi extingu@@ ished . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several implement@@ ations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can use something else such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for the display and to merge . the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can customize the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without really exec@@ uting it
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; if the scan of the folders is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder that was found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by folding the arrow keys to the left / right side . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the plug @-@ in action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of any problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then , folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is selected , then an error message error : files are different but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file will be processed after the other . it displays status column when the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok anywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all of the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , B will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B will be selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory merging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if there are still invalid merging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Exec@@ utes , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window opens ( notice the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select again directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; when you lock the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . thus , you have the option to select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not merge . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . the default plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to that pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a pre@@ defined dot file marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; trun@@ cated . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ ges@@ date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when the chan@@ ges@@ date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file as action is suggested . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merging view is visible to the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file together without first having to start the folder merging . once you save the result , the current file will be reset , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merging . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relative and contain .. This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ ks &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
sometimes due to the file system on the server sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or change date will devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a differences observer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR first always starts the built @-@ in differences observer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences observer and then select In K@@ diffusion Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then de@@ eps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diffusion 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identi@@ cally ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
&quot; no sr@@ c will be removed , and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diffusion 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems while comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists from it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ insert ) add the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
&quot; show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . this also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be disabled in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source using the A , B and C cap@@ tion below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows are app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the des@@ kt@@ ops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as for several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only appears and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , you can move windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are furnished with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is shown as background in &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces will be displayed to enable them to be selected . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid appear , as from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with its contents . besides , it runs out of the control panel . &quot;
right click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key wind@@ ow@@ transparency mode and assign it to this one . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a lou@@ pe for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; if you like &amp; K@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fier window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ let mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the shift mouse poin@@ ter . please note that it is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; uses automatically your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and com@@ min@@ ers &amp; etc ; . &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use an area of the screen so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / K@@ mag ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor remains in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and any mouse @-@ click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer pain in the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those with mouse click em@@ ulate . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify this again , even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for each . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this refusal time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Fli@@ p is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait before it releases the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this feature is activated , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider of Sound @-@ Bu@@ ffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , it will be started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start from &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings are reset to the state after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best use is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be disabled at first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quick to see if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be done by letting the mouse button finish . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . as a result , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . however , place the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to highlight this way to copy it into the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key pressed while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is repeated every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows must be installed . this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter dies briefly . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and the pressing of the mouse buttons .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sets from a list of conversation history phrases that are to be discussed again . &quot;
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the vocabulary word for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org document so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the user memory . you can select phrases that are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word completion and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the voice card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character encoding , with the text passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . for examples , see App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications require a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field .
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can determine whether the text passages book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passages book will not be saved . if you want to ask before saving , ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages are to be saved . &quot;
the word completion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
&quot; using the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the running memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the running memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the running memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and pulling the toolbar , the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar over the editing window . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language edition command for voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ed@@ file , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax willingly swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , print text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions is stored , which the user can always re@@ generate . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer contains . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the &amp; k@@ de voice output system ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications .
&quot; speech output takes place via speech speech @-@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of language expendi@@ tures on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the c@@ de @-@ access@@ mailing list , subscribe to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and configure speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program . see also &quot;
&quot; during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed in General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; when you click the map@@ maker speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card reader is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the top speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not specify a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops system .
&quot; choose a voice type , three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls vote . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the speaker tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the card in General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system ; click the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ m@@ gr termin@@ ates , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , provided the field language edition is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears when reading the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text assignments . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the orders are only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should be read and select the Text output from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ amps and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should be read and select the Text output from the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Post@@ ers ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system by &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of events , you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message when your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry Noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box because it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech therap@@ ist . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , choosing wrong spoken words or short@@ cuts , choosing a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and accepts these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issue of warning .
&quot; news have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you want to read a long text on a web page , you can welcome anyone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text assignments . each order that you initiate by the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text assignments . text assignments are intended for output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; drawing She@@ ets replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string label filters , which enable the creation of chat buttons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable shape . &quot;
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send assignments to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent by the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card chart speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the established standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
&quot; for setting up drawing tok@@ ens , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily ; it must differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replaced . the list is processed in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text editor speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ trl key pressed . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs are available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string release filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filtering if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. so words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the k@@ nut@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the utility x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the speaker selection filter lets you send text to a specific speaker , set up on the speaker map speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can design@@ ate that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the board card . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this one by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want to use . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the required requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Add Filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; these synthes@@ iz@@ ers can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and an option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers mentioned supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be solved by a string release filter . &quot;

the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license which you will find in the corresponding documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; find the source code of c@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the development team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and extract , you will need a current K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) development environment , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for c@@ high@@ lighting , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check whether speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the &quot; &quot; shell script &quot; &quot; SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops which uses the speech speech @-@ pat@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ pat@@ cher is possible and that the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can return pun@@ ctu@@ ation or set @-@ wise , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application displays text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click Add Ad@@ ding on the map tab , and in order to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the board card speaker unit will be shown below . in the following , you will find the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for quotes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display them gray , the selected voice does not let these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , do not yet have a speaker set up ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can advance or decline in the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
with a click on OK all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and compiled ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the Spe@@ aker &apos;s speed here . 50@@ 1 % corresponds to about half and 200@@ .00 % about double normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and accepts these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the spending of screen readers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;

&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 . % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ es@@ hop filter filters ( SD@@ B @-@ filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds support text into individual phrases . this allows you to skip or skip orders faster , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ down filter filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional set @-@ down filter filters , but beginners will be advised . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . switch off the speakers sel@@ ections and select text to read . switch on the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you must have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ops ; then faster with reading , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then pause or cancel text assignments on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal typ@@ es@@ hop filter filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
filter marks compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and paste a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard typ@@ ed filter label keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mess@@ ages , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal typ@@ o filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; on the speaker selection box , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the board card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are defined .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also set several marks here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a prime property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is present when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the features in the speaker area , which is best to delete the following , click the Def@@ ault button to use the standard speaker and then click on Spo@@ kes@@ person closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , it may be a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output above AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . when I pause a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / voices . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and search@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML ; ) . ( see ) or , if you are very bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags for converting SS@@ ML . the same is true for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added an own string release filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set up or go back . on the box of orders it is shown that the order is only out of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for set @-@ down recognition . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
gam@@ ers in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops ; execute the command @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts in the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . you can also find possible solutions for this problem on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; stop , the current sentence is still read @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only prepared on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ ts installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ moun@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . to do so , find the instructions provided by the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions when sharing . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice delivery system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download the MS German Festival &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the recording of bug fixes is not necessary ; you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; to give and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then , download festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
extract the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip into the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ fty language synthes@@ izer which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can not adjust sound height , volume nor speech speed . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the distri@@ butions , so pick Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthesis is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
&quot; load at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and un@@ zip them into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder . &quot;
&quot; either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ fty language synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume in this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ mu@@ ms@@ gr . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the Epo@@ s programs do not appear in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . in the input fields , you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ fty language synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console , on the command line . &quot;
use a command to write the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection from K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to enable the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be shown in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the Network Settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
the Network Settings module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting is selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from , which is best suited to distribution and rel@@ e@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access the system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available , which is divided into three riders : &quot;
the network interfaces section is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Interface :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... set up in the device dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system will be performed at any system start , so no further adjustment is required . either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected in the selection list . &quot;
&quot; with the manual , you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . activating a disabled network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ ing part of the Rei@@ ki nam@@ ing solution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the Edit button . the Edit dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; the list of known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add ... the New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple alias names , press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially familiar computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box will be edited .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) ranges when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and others are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found a wide spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently concentrating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator can be used to use a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly re @-@ sorted by the scripts in the Su@@ SE system . &quot;

&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you will see a list of related tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and opened . &quot;
&quot; if the task is disabled , program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears disabled . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables that appear here do not force the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed here , except for power . if the variable is de@@ activated , the description will appear as a description . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . then go to the Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also right @-@ click on the Tas@@ ks folder and click New ... Select or C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program you want to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , click Select . &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to run . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in Fi@@ fth steps .
&quot; if you specify both monthly and week@@ day ( s ) , the task is executed both at a suitable date and on a suitable day of the week . for example , if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected months regardless of the day of the week , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to remove . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select cut out , or press C@@ trl ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the function to be copied . then go to Edi@@ ting Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first one has to be cut out or copied to the clip@@ board . only then , inser@@ ting is available at all . select the Tas@@ ks folder . then go to Edit In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the tasks folder and select In@@ sert , or press C@@ trl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select one . then go to the Edit menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and modify ... Select , or press C@@ trl ; O. It will appear to edit the task in which you can edit the task chosen above . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to be deleted . go to the Edit menu item . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activate a task , select it and determine the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select En@@ able . make sure program name , parameter and description will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to execute a task immediately , select it and then proceed to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . go to the Edit New@@ menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variables folder and select New ... or press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variables . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the array for the variable name . these are :
to send emails from the program to another than the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the cop@@ ing variable . then go to Edi@@ ting Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert an environment variable , first one has to be cut out or copied to the clip@@ board . only then is the option to be inserted at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to be working . then go to Edit ... alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and modify ... select , or press C@@ trl ; O . then the dialog appears , in which , as described above , you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in a de@@ activated variable , it appears de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will become active only then . &quot;
&quot; the default k@@ de appears ; dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time plans of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant and UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; D ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; trained the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; dat ; the preview on the tape is not , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects &amp; dat ; the default , search for the right index on your disk . if it is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes in order to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&amp; D ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the connection for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; D , it needs to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a type of band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive does not need to be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , you continue with the format of the tape . all data on the belt will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before setting up the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item Check ...
&quot; once the test is started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with one tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restore , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index in two types :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are stored as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ it@@ ters &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command loads load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when releasing &amp; dat , the tape will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ flo@@ aters . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to tell the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The string ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users provide fast access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , it allows experienced users to quickly access information on problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that help to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among others :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the startup , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open it , and it opens up instead of its a small message window , so you have started &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or by entered strings . in the default setting , the list of the log lines is changed automatically , so that only minutes lines are displayed next to the filter . then a Log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of the step indication . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off the setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the sync protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can switch to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a Log to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program start when you run the system in the &amp; Linux world , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not mention here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how starts and stops in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script will run with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not tri@@ vial . simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop it ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ ing or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will not only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab key to activate the various working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the entry button to change the properties dialog . use the Tab key to change the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu will require confirmation before exec@@ uting them . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . Pre@@ ferences are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the li@@ lo -@@ prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard corresponds to . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v plan to extend the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) end simply without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation by &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either you use the corresponding toolbar icon or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will appear where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords are installed , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card card password management appears , if shadow passwords are installed , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this card only appears if space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space restrictions in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the file system file system with space limitation .
&quot; the groups , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Ad@@ ding from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button of the toolbar . the Edit or Del@@ ete of the selected user or group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove , and modify the boot password , change the time to bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change , change , change , and more . &quot;
